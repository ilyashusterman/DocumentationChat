Introduction
This document helps marketer (app owner) product managers plan and execute their onboarding with AppsFlyer. For every item, the owner and approximate implementation time are provided.
Note that:

Step 1 (account setup) is done once by an account admin.
Steps 2-4 are mandatory for every app added to AppsFlyer (except where stated as optional).
Certain items from step 5 may be mandatory to meet your business goals.
The time estimates in this article are intended as general guidance only. They are based on our experience working with many new customers, but we recognize that every app owner, app, and implementation is different. Your actual time requirements may vary.

Step 1: Account setup



Item
Owner
Time

Sign up with AppsFlyer
Account admin
5 mins
Ideally, an account admin is a real AppsFlyer user who can receive important messages when needed.



Add account users who will use the AppsFlyer dashboard, and set their permissions
Account admin
1 min per account user
If adding an account user fails, it's often because their email address was added to a different account. To add them to the new account, either use a different email address or delete them from the other account.



Result: Welcome! You now have an active AppsFlyer account and account users who can access it.

Add your app to the AppsFlyer account

If adding an app fails, it's often because it was previously defined in a different account (typically an ad agency that your marketers work with). Contact your CSM or hello@appsflyer.com to transfer the app to your account.

The re-attribution window is the period, starting from the date of the first install, during which re-installs from the same device are not attributed as new installs. The default value is 90 days, which you can customize as needed. 


[Optional] Migrate existing user devices into AppsFlyer

If your app already has a substantial user base, consider migrating them into AppsFlyer to avoid double charges.

Consider the available options and select the SDK functionalities you want your app to use

Some considerations beyond basic attribution:

Will your campaigns deep link users into the app?
Will the app need to access attribution or deep-linking data?
Should AppsFlyer data contain your Customer User ID for reference?
How will you implement privacy settings for iOS 14+ devices? Will you measure uninstalls, run cross-promotion campaigns, and more?
