button your mobile website and redirects visitors download your app the urls also support install attribution and deep linking migrate onelink smart script landing pages are very common technique among digital marketers they allow the marketers capture their leads details for remarketing even these users don convert first however for mobile user acquisition the landing page strategy has upsides and downsides the upsides leads who eventually get install should more engaged with the app the more complicated services for example financial services require more explanations convert their leads which enabled landing pages the downsides the longer funnel reduces the final number converted leads more technically challenging attribute the challenges mobile attribution landing pages different media sources require different methods complete the landing page scenario with the correct attribution data last click attribution model may cause loss correct attribution the landing page has its own attribution links direct website visitors are recorded organic unless the landing page has its own attribution links desktop visitors are recorded organic unless the landing page has method recording their conversions into mobile users the solution solve the mentioned landing page attribution problems you need implement javascript flow your landing page offer sample script implementation that you can use make sure adjust the script fit your requirements some cases you also need make some adjustments your campaigns the scenarios below cover the requirements for all possible media source cases landing page scenarios follow the implementation instructions below for all the media sources sending leads your landing pages facebook ads cross platform attribution description facebook srn which doesn use external attribution links upon first app launch appsflyer queries facebook whether the user has previously within the last days engaged with for the app the user has engaged with facebook the advertiser facebook self attributes facebook also attributes cross platform meaning that the user may interact with any type campaign mobile not any platform self attributed facebook conclusion lead with the available device coming from facebook landing page gets correctly attributed facebook this happens regardless the new click recorded the landing page however when users opt not share their device expected with ios users during facebook cross platform attribution may not work anymore when device sharing becomes optional use the other srns method for facebook ads new users who share their device would attributed facebook ads correctly new users who don share their device would attributed facebook instructions your facebook account create traffic conversions campaign with mobile attribution enabled sending leads your landing page landing page android download button direct link google play landing page ios download button direct link itunes attribution link without the device what the script does the landing page script makes changes the script designed detect user coming from facebook does doesn anything leaves the landing page direct links the app stores they are this prevents another click from being recorded which could affect ctr the script look for method called isfacebook learn more about what the script does when user comes from facebook google ads gclid offline conversion upload description the usual process for install attribution google ads campaigns requires clicking leads redirected the app store page url when redirecting leads from google ads landing page use mediator connect between the mobile install and the original click the non mobile google ads campaign conclusion the solution for google ads has parts the first part takes care attributing appsflyer the mobile users that get the landing page from google and install the app from there requires tagging the click urls from google identifying them the landing page and creating dynamic onelink with data from the url the second part takes care notifying google ads about these mobile installs using google offline conversion upload method note this gclid solution not officially supported recommended google case that google deprecates the gclid parameter will change the script support the changes recommend following this article clicking the follow button the article header get informed when there update the article attached script instructions part attributing google ads appsflyer google dashboard enable auto tagging here how with auto tagging enabled the url the landing page contains the gclid parameter url example http www yoursite com yourlandingpage gclid user gclid your landing page load activate the generateurl javascript function the function see below looks for the gclid parameter and builds long onelink url containing its value under the sub parameter you can use any the subscriber parameters sub sub landing page download button uses the generated onelink url onelink url example https yourapp onelink abcd pid google campaign name sub user parsed gclid new mobile users are attributed the google media source and the campaign name campaign optional postback sent the media source this point the installs are reported appsflyer under the google media source with the gclid but not google ads part uploading installs google offline conversions this step only required you want the conversions recorded the google ads platform for users attributed google the appsflyer raw data now displays the gclid value the sub column the gclid needed order upload offline conversions google ads you can find more information the process here the conversions can uploaded manually via adwords api more info the api here you can export the csvs with this information from your appsflyer account you can get this data from push api real time for every install tip you can also see the keywords your users searched for appsflyer raw data similar fashion getting the gclid for keyword recording you must include the keyword valuetrack parameter the final url from google ads the landing pageurl example http www yoursite com yourlandingpage gclid user gcli keyword user keyword the javascript function see below looks for the keyword parameter the value added the generated onelink url under keywordsonelink url example https yourapp onelink abcd pid google campaign name sub user parsed gclid keywords user parsed keyword the function below already contains the code parse the keyword parameter well what the script does google ads carry with them gclid parameter the script looks for this parameter the landing page url sees creates the onelink such that reflects that the user comes from google ads the script then puts the onelink the link behind the download buttons the landing page the script look for gclidvalue learn how the script detects users coming from google ads and creates the onelink accordingly other srns add parameter description other srns for example snapchat twitter are not cross platform like facebook and require bit work get your mobile users attributed them your campaigns with other srns lead your users the landing page and you are billed according clicking leads unrelated any derived mobile users conclusion when defining the landing page url for campaign srns besides facebook and google ads add partner parameter the url which states the original srn the landing page launches javascript see below that parses that parameter and builds onelink url which has the partner value when mobile users click that onelink and install they get attributed the stated media source instructions your srn account create non mobile campaign when defining the landing page url add partner landing page parameter the url which not attribution link the format pid srn see example below your landing page load activate the generateurl javascript function the function looks for the pid parameter and builds onelink url containing its value under the pid parameter landing page download button uses the generated onelink url new mobile users are attributed the custom partner landing page media source postback sent the media source you specify the real srn name twitter int postback might sent this srn this could result double charges see the note below for alternative names the script itself contains logic prevent you from using these names look for var srns the script you should see list srn names and condition that checks pidvalue any these names remove this logic after you are done testing the script note you sending users your landing page recommend that include the following parameter the url your landing page for twitter use pid twitter for snapchat use pid snapchat for doubleclick use pid doubleclick for facebook post unpaid use pid fbpost for oath formerly yahoo gemini use pid oath what the script does the script sees the pid parameter the landing page url and concludes that the user comes from srn some other custom network the script creates onelink accordingly and sets the link behind the download button the landing page learn more about what the script does look for pidvalue the script attribution links redirect with description attribution links are used for any media source which not srn that includes thousands integrated partners and any

name respectively note that with appsflyer attribution links which also contain utm parameters the appsflyer parameters are being used rather than the utm ones instructions the media source make sure the utm source exists the link utm campaign parameter optional but highly recommended your landing page load activate the generateurl javascript function the function looks for the utm source and utm campaign parameters and builds onelink url containing their values landing page download button uses the generated onelink url new mobile users are attributed the value utm source the media source

using the interface your selected cloud service described the tabs below the following requirements are relevant buckets both cloud services bucket name the bucket name must begin with dcr example dcr

usually named input example after creating the top level input folder your bucket folder structure might look something like this dcr example bucket bcc input second level folder for each data source you can regularly upload different data source files the dcr for processing each these data sources must assigned separate folder data source folders for example you plan upload files the dcr for

manually using the interface your selected cloud service example after creating data source folders your bucket folder structure might look something like this dcr example bucket bcc input data crm data nested subfolders for each date and version finally arrived the part the folder structure where the real action happens the folders which appsflyer continually looks for new data files read into the dcr each time you want appsflyer process data source file and run report based you upload new version the file the data source folder within series nested subfolders indicating the date and version number plus one extra subfolder let appsflyer know where the data within each data source folder subfolder for each date date folder format yyyy example within each date folder subfolder for each version that date version folder format example note the version folder required even you only upload the file one time per day within each version folder subfolder indicate the location the data data folder format data most cases you would use api calls other available programmatic means create the date version data folders automatically each time the data source file uploaded for additional information see the api references for your cloud service aws gcs since the full folder structure programmatically created the time files are uploaded realistic example includes both folders and files see this illustration the files tab below files data source files uploaded data source files must meet these name file format and location requirements must comply with dcr naming requirements csv

want deep link attributed users who definition being attributed don have the app installed for example you set campaign that aims bring back users who uninstalled the app the campaign promotes product service and you want serve the users with content related the product service that you advertise this referred deferred deep linking conversion data payload for deferred deep linking comes from the onconversiondatasuccess method deferred deep linking with srns deep link parameters defined srns campaigns are not available outside the srn this includes the parameter which holds the scheme path the app therefore implement deferred deep linking additional logic must applied for srn campaigns use the data onconversionsuccess response such campaign adset adgroup programmatically redirect your users

summer running shoe collection campaign activity the store and serves the running shoes for women category adset deferred deep linking with attribution links there are three ways deep link users uri schemes when using uri schemes for both attribution links and onelink the attribution link and payload are follows attribution link http app appsflyer com com appsflyer nivisampleapp pid media source

appears and set true look for the scheme and host fields scheme and host these fields come from the parameter the attribution link and indicate the scheme and activity which the user should deep linked ios universal links and android app links these are the other two out the three ways for performing deep linking when using universal links app links the onelink and payload are follows onelink short onelink https dhba onelink rad long onelink https dhba onelink rad pid media source name campaign name retargeting true payload install time cost cents usd campaign campaign name retargeting conversion type none first launch true click time click lookback orig cost status non organic iscache true shortlink media source media source name retargeting true shortlink field this the field that indicates the specific onelink that the user comes from helps the developer know how proceed terms launching activity and serving content other fields like campaign can also used for this purpose important the field shortlink does not appear the payload when using the long onelink both cases short long onelink recommend adding custom parameter that indicates the activity for example deep link activity shoes cateogry note using universal links and app links only possible with onelink engagement with srns much like with attribution campaigns when user engaged through srn the conversion data doesn indicate that this engagement campaign you can set the campaign name such that indicates engagement campaign engagement with regular networks here too the conversion data payload doesn indicate that the user comes from engagement campaign overcome this limitation you can set the campaign name indicate engagement engagement with deep linking major part engagement send the user specific activity for example you advertise some product sale such cases you want send the users who click the straight the app activity for this product sale you use deep linking the conversion data deep linking really important holds the information necessary for the developer customize the user experience and send them the correct activity engagement deep linking with srns conversion data not available when engaged user comes from srn the developer needs use the srn methods get upon app launch engagement deep linking with networks when user engaged and the app launches the following conversion data available the onappopenattribution method for both ios and android when using the short version onelink the conversion data structured map all the parameters the link example superapp deeplink pid media source name campaign name link https abcd onelink retargeting true the app developer can use such parameters like and campaign name send the user specific activity and serve the relevant content important recommend using the short version onelink click here learn more another reason use the short version onelink the conversion data structure that the long version returns when using the long version the conversion data map with single field called link that holds the entire long onelink link https abcd onelink pid media source campaign name retargeting true superapp fdeeplink alternative conversion data sources push api offers detailed conversion payload that indicates attribution engagement push api payloads include field called targeting conversion type this field indicates the type conversion either attribution engagement learn more see our push api guide raw data reports also contain indicators for the type conversion the raw data report for retargeting conversions there column called event name the value this column either engagement attribution according the type conversion examples mixed user acquisition and attribution examples user installs your app and then uninstalls the act installation puts the user attribution window you set user acquisition not retargeting campaign with facebook you also set the appsflyer integration with facebook allow retargeting while still the attribution window the user sees the clicks and reinstalls the app far appsflyer sees the user attributed user this due two factors the configuration with facebook allows retargeting the user the attribution window this case the campaign name doesn indicate attribution let take the same example only this time the user outside the attribution window this case the install new non organic install let look another example you set retargeting campaign facebook some users come across the campaign and install the app however these users install the app for the first

every day the selected time period limitations the retention report limitations are due limitations only results are displayed campaign name changes are not supported campaign name was changed the initial campaign name will display retention does not include reinstalls the report relates users attributed user acquisition campaigns the filter values are not dependent for example even when

short long onelink recommend adding custom parameter that indicates the activity for example deep link activity shoes cateogry note using universal links and app links only possible with onelink engagement with srns much like with attribution campaigns when user engaged through srn the conversion data doesn indicate that this engagement campaign you can set the campaign name such that indicates engagement campaign engagement with regular networks here too the conversion data payload doesn indicate that the user comes from engagement campaign overcome this limitation you can set the campaign name indicate engagement engagement with deep linking major part engagement send the user specific activity for example you advertise some product sale such cases you want send the users who click the straight the app activity for this product sale you use deep linking the conversion data deep linking really important holds the information necessary for the developer customize the user experience and send them the correct activity engagement deep linking with srns conversion data not available when engaged user comes from srn the developer needs use the srn methods get upon app launch engagement deep linking with networks when user engaged and the app launches the following conversion data available the onappopenattribution method for both ios and android when using the short version onelink the conversion data structured map all the parameters the link example superapp deeplink pid media source name campaign name link https abcd onelink retargeting true the app developer can use such parameters like and campaign name send the user specific activity and serve the relevant content important recommend using the short version onelink click here learn more another reason use the short version onelink the conversion data structure that the long version returns when using the long version the conversion data map with single field called link that holds the entire long onelink link https abcd onelink pid media source campaign name retargeting true superapp fdeeplink alternative conversion data sources push api offers detailed conversion payload that indicates attribution engagement push api payloads include field called targeting conversion type this field indicates the type conversion either attribution engagement learn more see our push api guide raw data reports also contain indicators for the type conversion the raw data report for retargeting conversions there column called event name the value this column either engagement attribution according the type conversion examples mixed user acquisition and attribution user installs your app and then uninstalls the act installation puts the user attribution window you set user acquisition not retargeting campaign with facebook you also set the appsflyer integration with facebook allow retargeting while still the attribution window the user sees the clicks and reinstalls the app far appsflyer sees the user attributed user this due two factors the configuration with facebook allows retargeting the user the attribution window this case the campaign name doesn indicate attribution let take the same example only this time the user outside the attribution window this case the install new non organic install let look another example you set retargeting campaign facebook some users come across the campaign and install the app however these users install the app for the first time such users are not considered attributed users instead appsflyer considers them users that come from user acquisition campaign"

unified view customer journeys across channels platforms including the website and devices this provides you with web app conversion paths analysis and raw data backend servers events occur independently user action either the website app for example automatic subscription renewal hybrid the event takes place your mobile website device having the app described this article app events are recorded calling the appsflyer sdk api using javascript this guide regards the hybrid scenario learn how bridge the gap between the html view and native views enabling you record events the html view and send them the app example you have hybrid app that offers subscriptions you implement the subscription form web view which actually loads from your website you can record the subscription app event the web view and send data related like subscription type price the native code the native code collects the data and uses the appsflyer sdk send the subscription app event recording app events hybrid apps this guide provide two methods for recording app events hybrid apps recommended javascript interface uses the native javascript interface order establish communication between the html web view and the native code this way you can send app event related data from the web view the native code once the native code obtains the data sends appsflyer using the sdk url loading this method the native code listens url loading events you can set the native code listen loading events specific urls and extract data from the url parameters the data then passed the sdk javascript interface both android and ios have native javascript interfaces that allow web views call native code android javascriptinterface ios javascriptcore advantages using the native javascript interface over url loading doesn require implementing logic that listens url loading native interfaces are preferable other implementations there need parse parameters from the url there less code and therefore less maintenance

appsflyer from another vendor includes the following main tasks sdk integration device migration campaign migration data report setup you can work these tasks simultaneously however recommend that you complete all the tasks before releasing your updated app with the appsflyer sdk pause existing marketing campaigns before performing the device migration tasks the following table describes the scope work required for each task see precise breakdown the general tasks the order you must accomplish them well record your progress download this spreadsheet scope work task action required who involved estimated time remarks prerequisites create appsflyer account add the app appsflyer optional change the default day attribution window align with your definition active users marketer appsflyer dashboard user hours sdk integration integrate appsflyer sdk your app map sdk app events update app version app stores app developers weeks recommended integrate the appsflyer sdk pre production app for testing production app must updated app stores after all other tasks are completed device migration optional migrate device ids avoid double attribution your existing users data engineer weeks consider pausing existing campaigns before migration and resuming them after app version updated consider repeating device migration the final migration date ensure complete coverage campaign migration integrate your networks appsflyer migrate existing campaigns from srns non srn networks owned media marketer manager weeks data report setup adapt map your current report structures appsflyer structures prepare receive appsflyer reports data engineer weeks sdk integration sdk integration the appsflyer sdk integrated into the app the link between the app and the appsflyer platform reports app installs app opens app events and integrate the appsflyer sdk integrate the appsflyer sdk into the app see the guides for android and ios sdk integration map app events you want recorded using the appsflyer schemes this can done via sdk remove the competing attribution vendor sdk you can this immediately and switch exclusively appsflyer run both sdks simultaneously for few weeks view breakdown these options the table below option what happens afterupdated app version release impact remove competitor sdk recommended only appsflyer records new installs and updating users competitor still shows events performed users until the users update their app too fast transition double attribution keep competitor sdk for transition period appsflyer and competitor attribute new installs and report events later date remove the competitor sdk data validation possible meaning you can compare data from appsflyer and the other vendor double attribution which may cause double charges with networks see example below higher workload after all other tasks the scope work are completed update the app version with appsflyer sdk the market new users are attributed appsflyer note make sure update the app for ios google play and any relevant android out store markets your android app may exist unofficial apk sites even you don know search the web for your app package name find out apk sites take some time update the latest version they may bring organic users which install old versions without appsflyer sdk app update rollouts the app stores can take couple days fully complete users installing during this phase may still get the previous version device migration optional about device migration device migration the process uploading list your existing user device ids idfa idfv gaid cuid into appsflyer you should perform this process before releasing the new app version which will include the appsflyer sdk there are two options when migrating devices attributed non attributed migration device migration solves data issues associated with existing app users who downloaded the app and were attributed your previous vendor for example srn double charges which occur when users originally attributed srn under your prior vendor and who are still within the lookback window are claimed the srn again under appsflyer example new user clicks facebook and installs your app june june the user updates the app the version with the appsflyer sdk and launches for appsflyer this new user that needs attributed real time appsflyer queries facebook with the user device because the user still within facebook day lookback window facebook self attributes the user this causes double charge the app owner for the same user once you migrate devices data reflects appsflyer follows installs data similar installs migrated devices have install data migrated device installs are not displayed appsflyer app events and sessions data recorded and displayed organic for non attributed device migration method attributed the media source and campaign using the attributed method retargeting attributions and engagements are displayed normally activity data displayed normally retention and cohort data migrated devices have install record such they aren associated with any cohort and can shown the retention and cohort reports how migrate devices migrate devices decide which user population migrate you can migrate all existing users which may prevent you from getting accurate attribution data from appsflyer users that only recently installed your app which may lead double charges somewhat older users recommend migrating users who are active during your current attribution window period for example your app has day attribution window migrate those users who have least one session during the previous days optional tell the marketer manager pause existing marketing campaigns from srns non srn networks owned media etc until after the device migration you decide not pause campaigns migrate any remaining device ids from the other vendor soon the updated app version with the appsflyer sdk released app stores prepare csv file based the user population selected using either the attributed non attributed migration structure see sample csv send your appsflyer csm the csv your csm will migrate the device ids appsflyer attributed migration devices migrated appsflyer with this method have their app events and sessions recorded and displayed according the media source reported the previous attribution vendor and according the networks data retention policies attributed device migration csv structure columnname description mand atory examples app app appears appsflyer dashboard yes android com great app ios platform device platform ios android yes ios android device android gaid ios idfv recommended available idfa not duplicate the same combination device and app multiple rows duplication occurs the last occurrence the file used yes gaid lower case idfv upper case idfa upper case vfnb type android advertiserid also supports amazon aid ios idfa idfv currently other identifiers oaid imei and android are not supported use non attributed migration for android users which are not from google play yes advertiserid idfa idfv install time the original app install time with the iso utc format yyyy ddthh sss best practice leave this field empty this case migration time used instead you fill the date must valid previous date not older than the attribution window some cases migrated devices upon first launch are treated new installs example device with install time preceding file creation date minus app attribution window not migrated with attribution first launch the device treated new install most likely organic example device migrated with install time but the first launch only happens after the migration and outside the attribution window this case new install recorded media source either appsflyer partner appears appsflyer dashboard custom media source cannot partner get the list partner ids required appsflyer enable all relevant integrated partners run the get active integrations api for list all active integrations use the media source name from the api the media source value the csv exceptions for apple search ads use apple search ads for twitter use twitter format values are case sensitive yes non organic facebook int googleadwords int organic organic integrated partner indicates whether the media source integrated partner not meaning organic custom media source format values are case sensitive yes yes media source custom campaign for more granular attribution details supply the original campaign name format string campaign for more granular attribution details supply the original campaign format string spaces permitted csv file rules csv file can contain user devices from multiple apps not duplicate the same combination device and app multiple rows duplication occurs the last occurrence the file used all column headers must included app platform device type install time media source integrated partner campaign campaign note the order the fields important and must maintained you can add both idfv and idfa for the same device but they must separate rows all fields the separate rows should the same except device each row must contain exactly fields separated commas leave non mandatory fields empty blank files can contain million rows you have multiple files give each file unique name encode data using utf optional compress files using zip gzip see sample csv non attributed migration devices migrated appsflyer with this method are recorded but not display organic users their app events and sessions are also recorded and displayed organic non attributed device migration csv file structure columns when use example app idfa gaid idfv all your android users have gaid identifiers ios only users app device device type some your android users have only imei android but not gaid out store markets android versions below android needs have hexadecimal format note use the exact strings for the type column advertiserid also supports amazon aid idfa idfv android imei you use android imei and later appsflyer receives better identifier new attribution may recorded csv file rules csv file can contain user devices from multiple apps each row contains single device per app files must include all column headers follows option file must include all column headers follows app device option app device type app ids lowercase android identifiers lowercase idfa idfv uppercase million rows permitted see sample csv campaign migration switch existing marketing campaigns appsflyer enable appsflyer attribution and avoid duplicate charges and the loss attribution data note you can choose only migrate few marketing campaigns time this case you can segment the ones you want migrate media source for example network agency geo campaign srns srns reply mobile measurement partners mmps when queried about engagements specific devices two mmps for example appsflyer and competing attribution vendor query the same srn about the same device install you may incur double charges migrate srn campaigns activate and configure relevant srns appsflyer note srns can run multiple mmps except facebook and twitter facebook cannot duplicate app events non srn networks network attribution links record the engagements users and are subsequently used attribute the engagements that become actual installs migrate non srn network campaigns activate the relevant networks appsflyer generate appsflyer attribution links for each network switch the existing links each your campaigns with the appsflyer attribution links owned media owned media refers attribution links you use content sharing web app email sms social media posts blogs internet communities quora etc and more for these campaigns appsflyer uses onelink custom links onelink custom links redirect users based their device the correct app store directly into the app web url landing page change your links for other vendors into appsflyer onelinks contact your csm who will assist you with the bulk migration all your links skan for skadnetwork skan attribution you can only have one sdk update the conversion value otherwise skan data rendered meaningless therefore make sure that after migration only the appsflyer sdk updates the skan conversion value learn about setting the skan conversion value appsflyer data report setup adapt and map report structures before migration your systems store your

aggregate the data way that best suits your business needs for example you need understand cost data the campaign and country level use those dimensions standardization across networks not all

domain with the attribution link being click abcdef com branded domains improve campaign performance because they drive trust capitalize your branding ensure consistent identity remove friction from user journeys and improve ctr rates allow deep linking using your brand are simple implement and behave the same onelinks promote brand awareness your brand marks your campaigns instead generic link enable emails avoid being flagged spam due the link not matching the sender email principles implementation branded domains are implemented associating full domain defined your domain name system dns with onelink subdomain the appsflyer cname destination this done using standard settings your dns and setting branded domain appsflyer addition you will need make some minor changes your app support branded domains you will need the assistance the dns admin usually member your team your dns hosting provider and the app developer multiple full domains can associated with single onelink subdomain this means you can have multiple brands using the same onelink subdomain setting branded domains complete the action list set branded domain responsibility action remarks marketer assisted the dns admin set branded link appsflyer the dns admin usually member your team your dns hosting provider needs define the full domain aka host and set cname record described the procedure developer set

branded domain consists associating full domain set your dns with onelink subdomain appsflyer depicted the following figure branded domain pointing appsflyer servers before you begin choose full domain name for example app abcdef com where abcdef com your brand the subdomain for example app can also customized request that the dns admin create the full domain aka host request that the dns

sdk versions android and later ios and later user invite referral invite friend requires sdk version and later for both ios and android branded domains sdk implementation considerations when deep

following are some examples what you can learn from measuring uninstalls and how you can use the data optimize campaigns and user engagement compare the quality sources comparing the quality users acquired from different sources media sources campaigns creatives and geo you can determine the media sources with the lowest uninstall rates and reallocate funds them example you are marketer gaming apps for playit gaming international you have just launched new app and you are running campaigns two different media sources media source and media source when you check the dashboard you see that although media source has the highest number installs also has the highest uninstall rate media source the other hand has installs and the lowest uninstall rate based these insights you could reallocate more your budget media source and try acquire more engaged users share uninstall data with networks for optimization sending uninstall event postbacks the networks you work with useful for optimizing user acquisition campaigns you can send the uninstall event mapping uninstall your network once the mapping complete event sent each time user identified having uninstalled the app networks can use this information determine which users are less engaged and focus getting more engaged users example you are marketer gaming apps for playit gaming international media source network that you are working with the launch your new android app the previous campaign you ran with media source new users installed your app and subsequently users uninstalled the app for the new campaign you want media source receive uninstall data this will allow media source quickly address uninstall challenges based insights from the previous campaign media source creates campaign exclusion list that excludes specific types users from ads running your new campaign users who have already proven that they are lower value for your app users who regularly uninstall your apps this allows media source optimize audience targeting make sure that your campaign budget not wasted users who don need see certain campaign ads exclude uninstalls from retargeting campaigns some cases comply with regulations like gdpr and ccpa you might need exclude users that uninstalled your app from retargeting campaigns uninstall information allows you create exclusion lists and apply privacy measures protect your customers privacy and data methods exclude users include the following raw data reports manual method which you retrieve list uninstalled users from the uninstalls report and create exclusion list appsflyer audiences automatic method which you define target audience based specific criteria for example users who haven uninstalled your app users that don meet the criteria are excluded from the audience example you are marketer gaming apps for playit gaming international you are running retargeting campaign for one your android apps and you decide use appsflyer audiences define retargeting

purchase events were performed all app users during specific month use activity data compare user behavior the current month relative previous month ltv data ltv data are the events performed during the lifetime user who converted installed the app specific date range for example use ltv data see the roi the present day users who installed your app during specific month events performed users who

campaign optimization depends ltv data advertisers find both types data useful but for different purposes for this reason both are available what data can you use compare media sources which pages and reports can you compare appsflyer how you compare ltv and activity data the train analogy this analogy will help you understand the difference between ltv and activity data activity imagine you watching passing train the train passes you see only the actions performed the passengers the train they pass this activity data ltv now imagine that you board train observer the train divided into railroad cars you board the car with other passengers the departure platform this the install during the journey you able observe all the actions performed the passengers the car you observe the

there are two differences between ltv and activity data when looking the same date range the differences are activity data includes events from installs that happened before the date range ltv data includes events that happened after the date range compare the two types data correctly need neutralize the differences this can achieved retrieving ltv data from the activity data vice versa note minor differences between similar sources are still possible due differences report generation time retrieving ltv data out raw activity data the export data page set the current day the last day the date range difference solved download the raw app events report use the install time column filter out installs prior the first day the date range difference solved note while activity data remains constant over time ltv data changes when existing users perform new app events the ltv data you see today may different tomorrow for the same date range retrieving activity data out ltv data compare the ltv based overview page with external source which activity based you must overcome the two differences you can only this selecting sources that started sending installs within the specified date range appsflyer difference solved this ensures the activity data does not include events performed within the date range that belong installs that happened prior the date range setting the current day the last day the date range difference solved this ensures the ltv data does not include events performed after the date range that belong installs that happened within the date range conclusion when

what value they bring during given period you can identify and highlight user journeys with the help the appsflyer the generated for each app install per device the remains unchanged throughout the user lifecycle from install uninstall the persists the user resets their device since the install and app events reports have the same structure they can merged into single report the merged report you can aggregate and filter appsflyer and customer user available analyze user journeys examples engaged user strong user installed the app august the merged report shows that they made purchases august august and august from this conclude that the user engaged user they made purchase one hour after launching the app and continued purchasing the days following the install engaged user weak user installed the app july the merged report shows that they added item their cart august but there are subsequent purchase events you can assume that the user hesitant make purchase and choose retarget them with the item they added the cart analyzing the user journey for campaign optimization the user acquisition manager travel app downloads the install and app event reports and merges them then view user journeys the app they filter aggregate data appsflyer they notice that given user identified their appsflyer downloaded the app months ago and booked flight several days later subsequently the user viewed few flight deals but didn make any bookings looking further the manager discovers more users with the same pattern and decides dig even deeper they find that most these users came from campaign run media source turns out that this and campaign targeted users who wanted travel specific destination analyzing the user journey the manager might conclude that the campaign

facebook also attributes cross platform meaning that the user may interact with any type campaign mobile not any platform self attributed facebook action tell your developer use the skiplist method disable the smart script for facebook any other strings you want facebook any the strings the skip list appear the http referrer the click the smart script returns null note facebook cross platform attribution may affected when users opt not share their device expected with ios users during google ads gclid and utm parameters the usual process for install attribution google ads campaigns which carry gclid parameter requires clicking leads redirected the app store page url since this case you are redirecting leads from google ads web landing page the script takes the gclid parameter from the google ads install campaign url and puts into the outgoing url your choice output parameter sub note this applies install campaigns for non aci search campaigns meaning engagement campaigns google may attributed the media source despite the smart script output prerequisite the google dashboard enable auto tagging with auto tagging enabled the url contains the gclid parameter set the script for google ads make list the media source and campaign parameter names that are the incoming links for example utm source and utm campaign select parameter the outgoing url contain the gclid best practice select sub that the data displays appsflyer raw data reports provide these the list parameters the web developer result the values the media source and campaign parameters utm source and utm campaign the incoming link are used populate the values for the pid and parameters the outgoing link the outgoing url the gclid the value the sub param notify google ads about these installs get the gclid data from the param sub via csv push api real time for every install upload the gclid data google either manually via adwords api note this gclid solution not officially supported recommended google case google deprecates the gclid parameter will change the script support the changes follow this article clicking the follow button the article header get informed when there update the article attached script srns owned media and other media source links srns like snapchat twitter work differently than google ads cross platform like facebook campaigns from these srns lead your users the web landing page and you are billed according clicking leads unrelated any derived mobile users for these srns script setup the same for links from owned media other media sources you might use set the script make list the media source and campaign parameter names that are the incoming links provide these the list parameters the web developer the srn media source type should the media source value the incoming url and the script finds and uses the pid value the outgoing onelink url behind the download button the web landing page you want change the outgoing pid provide the incoming media source value and the replacement pid value the pid override list result for these srns media sources the values the media source and campaign parameters the incoming link are used populate the values for the

contain web form where they fill their details get sms email with link download the app you create the web form and provide the url the script result the script detects the device platform the user desktop the script generates outgoing onelink url that redirects the user your dedicated web landing page see also desktop app conversion agencies installs are attributed agencies using the prt

journey series steps that the user performs before achieving goal like purchasing product booking flight the idea behind analyzing user journey see what the user does the app how active they are and what value they bring during given period you can identify and highlight user journeys with the help the appsflyer the generated for each app install per device the remains unchanged throughout the user lifecycle from install uninstall the persists the user resets their device since the install and app events reports have the same structure they can merged into single report the merged report you can aggregate and filter appsflyer and customer user available analyze user journeys examples engaged user strong user installed the app august the merged report shows that they made purchases august august and august from this conclude that the user engaged user they made purchase one hour after launching the app and continued purchasing the days following the install engaged user weak user installed the app july the merged report shows that they added item their cart august but there are subsequent purchase events you can assume that the user hesitant make purchase and choose retarget them with the item they added the cart analyzing the user journey for campaign optimization the user acquisition manager travel app downloads the install and app event reports and merges them then view user journeys the app they filter aggregate data appsflyer they notice that given user identified their appsflyer downloaded the app months ago and booked flight several days later subsequently the user viewed few flight deals but didn make any bookings looking further the manager discovers more users with the same pattern and decides dig even deeper they find that most these users came from campaign run media source turns out that this and campaign targeted users who wanted travel specific destination analyzing the user journey the manager might conclude that the campaign was too narrowly focused and that users weren sufficiently engaged the app feature reports reports relating additional features available the platform revenue incrementality skadnetwork postbacks use

    "text": "glance measure the incremental lift generated retargeting campaigns related reading running incrementality experiment audiences incrementality blog the incrementality testing guide for marketers what incrementality probably the best way understand incrementality analysis through example say you recently ran remarketing campaign for the sake simplicity say was with only one network the campaign conversion rate was now you want evaluate the success the campaign and you need answer important and course the most difficult questions good conversion rate for this campaign how know that the campaign truly resulted driving additional conversions was the campaign worth the cost running order answer these questions accurately and without bias must consider more than just measured conversions must take into account the number users who would have converted organically even they had never engaged with remarketing campaign this difference between total conversions and those that would have happened anyway known incremental lift sometimes simply lift and critical determining the true value campaign can quite difficult measure but that precisely what appsflyer incrementality designed incrementality experiments incrementality overcomes the challenge measuring incremental lift allowing you create scientifically valid experiments compare the behavior similar groups these groups vary only that some groups the test groups are exposed your campaign and one group the control group not learn more about creating and running incrementality experiments calculation methodology the following sections explain the calculations behind the numbers reported the incrementality dashboard lift appsflyer incrementality employs alternative methods for calculating lift intent treat reach based while reach based methodology preferable for purposes evaluating campaign performance its calculation requires the measurement data points not provided all networks for these networks intent treat methodology used instead note prior december lift was calculated using solely the intent treat method however data for earlier dates has been updated utilize reach based lift where applicable therefore you can review historical experiments analyze their results light the new methodology itt based lift intent treat itt experimental methodology has its foundations medical science using itt researchers randomly split given population between control group who are not treated and test group whom researchers intend treat researchers measure the efficacy given treatment comparing the results the groups whether not test group member actually received treatment not taken into account similarly remarketing the lift metric measures campaign efficacy doesn matter user the test group actually engaged with campaign received treatment because the intent that relevant calculating incrementality other words results are calculated every member the test group actually engaged with the campaign when used appsflyer incrementality uses itt based lift calculation for srns although not the preferred method for measuring lift our context itt remains scientifically sound experimental method and provides valid results when reach based calculation not possible interpreting results the underlying assumption that all members the test group were actually reached campaign often results low conversion rates and consequence low incremental lift reach based lift its name implies reach based lift calculation takes into account whether not member the test group was actually reached served campaign prior converting addition requiring additional data reach based lift calculation also more complex that requires certain mathematical adjustments the control group order statistically valid these adjustments are cumulatively known the creation counterfactual control group when used appsflyer incrementality uses reach based lift calculation for non srns attribution link networks while the preferred method for calculating lift reach based calculation requires that networks report the following data appsflyer impression data campaign from the attribution link this data not reported incrementality measurement not available and displays the incrementality dashboard interpreting results since reach based lift calculation takes into account only test group members that were actually reached campaign networks that are measured using reach based incrementality will usually show amplified results positive lift will become much higher and negative lift will become much lower best practices because the different lift calculation methodologies can yield significantly different results the following best practices are recommended order make interpretation more meaningful when creating your experiments select audiences that are split only among control group and one more networks the same type either attribution link networks non srns for reach based calculation srns for itt based calculation your initial experiments consider using audience split only between single network and control group this makes less likely that comparisons will made among more networks for which different lift calculations are used statistical significance when evaluating the validity incrementality experiments sound scientific methodology requires that consider statistical significance the level confidence that the lift result isn due random events chance the incrementality dashboard significance reported percentage for each media source the percentage indicates the likelihood that the results for that media source would repeat themselves the experiment were performed again under similar circumstances statistical significance determined below the dashboard will display unreliable results instead percentage significance affected audience size experiment duration and media source performance scaled control group for test group level metrics opposed per user metrics lift calculated based scaled control group other words the size the control group adjusted match the control group size for each media source example assume the following scenario test group size for network members control group size members experiment results network had conversions the control group had conversions total conversions will adjusted based assumed scaled control group size members

system appsflyer and facebook differ their attribution models this may cause discrepancies occur between facebook and appsflyer dashboards while work closely with facebook minimize these discrepancies advertisers should aware the following causes for them detect discrepancy between appsflyer and facebook compare events listed facebook event manager those appsflyer reports the number events varies significantly there may discrepancy differences attribution models cause facebook appsflyer click attribution lookback window days note that there are some specific cases where the default different days make sure set days with facebook view through attribution lookback window day note that there are some specific cases where the default different day default but can configured hours keep this default value multi channel sourceattribution facebook self attributes installs regardless other media sources appsflyer uses last click attribution more information about appsflyer attribution available here cross device attribution facebook attributes its users that click and install different devices for example ios android desktop appsflyer attributes single devices which perform both the engagement and the install different time zones facebook ads default reporting time zone pst make sure change facebook ads manager match the app time zone defined the app settings appsflyer appsflyer default app time zone utc you can change the time zone set for the app the app settings page match the time zone defined facebook ads manager google install referrer when install without advertiser was attributed facebook ads using the google play install referrer appsflyer doesn report back facebook ads this will cause discrepancy since display appsflyer and not facebook ads deeplink engagement attribution deeplinked engagement not reported back facebook ads this will cause discrepancy since display appsflyer and not facebook ads click through and view through attribution appsflyer supports both click through and view through attribution minimize discrepancies between facebook ads and appsflyer make sure that both the click through and view through lookback windows are consistent with the default ones defined facebook ads facebook ads default click through lookback window defined days although there are some specific cases where the default different recommended set the click through lookback window appsflyer days cover all facebook ads default options compare the click through and view through attribution windows facebook with those appsflyer visit facebook recommend configuring the attribution windows appsflyer according facebook values they are shown the following screenshot example suppose that the facebook click lookback window configured appsflyer day for your app com greatapp while facebook has the default value days users that click greatapp facebook but launch the app for the first time after days are attributed organic users appsflyer while facebook self reports these users restricted media discrepancies until october attribution data users brought view through attribution vta was restricted and not available advertisers starting october the restrictions apply users brought both view and click through attribution aggregated reporting was not affected this since facebook ads doesn send user level data appsflyer might not attribute conversion assisting impressions and clicks facebook ads example user sees clicks facebook for awesomeapp then later they see and click greatadnetwork for awesomeapp and install facebook ads claims the conversion since occurred within their lookback window appsflyer attributes the conversion greatadnetwork they had the last engagement before install appsflyer won consider facebook ads conversion assisting network since facebook ads raw data restricted however for click through attribution the directs users google play store attribution fields are available advertisers the google install referrer the fields provided via the referrer populate appsflyer raw data reports available you and enable appsflyer attribute users who don have advertising lat enabled app events differences the differences between platforms may also present with post install events for example app purchases that are displayed facebook and appsflyer the following table describes the most common reasons for these differences and advised how minimize them cause description appsflyer tip self attribution facebook always attributes events its own campaigns that drove them while appsflyer attributes these events the acquisition source installs and events which facebook incorrectly self attributes are indicated assists appsflyer combine raw data facebook attributed conversions with raw data where facebook the contributor different lifetime definition user lifetime facebook defined days meaning facebook doesn show events they occurred over days after the click appsflyer facebook user lifetime defined days when assessing the value users from facebook campaigns that occurred after days use appsflyer data get broader picture unmapped events appsflyer gets sdk originated events but they are not mapped facebook and therefore aren sent make sure map with facebook all the app events that signify users quality unsent revenue appsflyer gets the revenue from the sdk originated events but they are not sent facebook make sure the send revenue boxes the app events are always checked for example the purchase event the capture below missing event values facebook appsflyer sends parameters and values facebook part the events mapping they have the correct structures build your sdk app events according appsflyer recommended structures fully map the event values with facebook installs from engagement campaigns dashboard engagement campaign can cause users open already installed app engagement alternately when appsflyer recognizes previous install the app existed the same device appsflyer may refer that conversion attribution engagement campaign facebook targets new users users that have installed the app for the first time after more than the set attribution window following the original installation these users are recorded new user acquisition installs appsflyer which belong engagement campaigns facebook the other hand installs that take place within the set attribution window following the original installation are considered attributions and appear the retargeting page appsflyer while they may appearing new installs facebook note while facebook shows all installs retargeting campaign the same place the appsflyer dashboard installs are divided between the overview page new installs and the retargeting page attribution and engagements cross device attribution facebook reports cross device attribution this could sometimes cause issues where campaign for one platform ios android shows installs another platform example linda clicks mobile greatapp facebook using her android phone facebook records the click done linda under the original android targeted campaign android females linda decides install greatapp her home ipad upon first launch appsflyer asks facebook for the origin this ios install and facebook answers with the campaign android females validation rules and protect you use appsflyer validation rules results may differ between appsflyer and facebook when there are rejected installs that originally come from facebook these cases facebook self reports installs itself while appsflyer rejects the same installs similarly you use appsflyer anti fraud solution protect there may installs since facebook self reports while appsflyer rejects example jeff the manager greatapp creates campaign called spna which targets only spanish speakers north america verify this jeff defines validation rule that accepts users from canada and the only when facebook user from spain clicks and installs facebook self reports the install while appsflyer rejects the install that doesn pass the validation rule sdk related discrepancies there could several occasions when advertisers implement both appsflyer and facebook ads sdks this might cause discrepancies both for installs and app events installs cases when facebook ads sdk initialized the app launch before the appsflyer sdk the install recorded only facebook ads and not appsflyer verify that the appsflyer sdk initialized app launch before the facebook ads sdk app events facebook ads does not duplicate app events which are reported from both sdks this means that facebook ads may report falsely report revenue and other events use either the following methods avoid duplicate app event reporting facebook ads don configure events the facebook sdk disable the facebook app events

logic appsflyer takes the following into consideration when determining what smart banner display are there rules dismissal behavior frequency capping locations show pages etc set for the banner groups does the end user meet the rule conditions and qualify see banner the answer both questions yes meaning there are rules and the user qualifies see banner appsflyer chooses banner display explained the table that follows banner group setup which banners display example single banner group appsflyer evenly splits the display all active banners all your banner groups between all eligible users example there active banner displays all users example there are banners users see banner and the other see banner example there are banners eligible users see each banner example there are active banners nothing displays multiple banner groups with identical rules appsflyer evenly splits the display all active banners all your banner groups between all eligible users there are banner groups and each with banners for total banners eligible users see each banner multiple banner groups with multiple rules appsflyer evenly splits the display all active banners from the banner group with rules that most specifically describes and match the users the banner groups are equally specific different ways banners from all these banner groups display example there are banner groups and banner group set show worldwide and banner group set show japan banner group more specific only the banners from that group display users japan the group has active banners nothing displays example there are banner groups and banner group set show worldwide and banner group set show everywhere except ukraine banner group more specific only the banners from that group display worldwide users except users ukraine banner group has active banners nothing displays banner group displays ukraine example there are banner groups and banner group set show japan and banner group set show april both banner groups are equally specific but different ways therefore japan april banners from both banner groups display neither banner group has priority over the other testing banner performance you can test banners comparing their performance the performance dashboard for additional attribution related data recommended add the adset other attribution parameters except pid and channel with unique value for each banner creative banner group use those parameters compare each banner group performance when viewing data appsflyer dashboards and reports faq why does banner not display this due the frequency cap set your banner group frequency capping determines how many times the banner shown unique user for example frequency capping set three and user visits the site four times the user sees the banner the first visits but not the fourth and onward frequency capping can disabled select frequency capping value disable frequency capping can add parameters the url smart banners yes you can use either the showbanner function updateparams function add parameters the urls your smart banners smart banners support deep linking yes add the deep link value parameter one the following ways the appsflyer add static custom attribution parameter during banner setup use additionalparams the showbanner function add the parameter the url prior displaying the banner use the updateparams function add the parameter the url after the banner displays make sure your developer implements the desired behavior the deep link value can smart banners show different content based whether not users have the app installed you don know whether not users have the app recommend you make your call action applicable both for example the app open the app when users navigate from the original landing page with the banner different pages the site and then back the page with the banner are the original incoming url parameters still available for the smart banner url yes the original incoming url contains utm source pid parameter the original url saved for the duration the browsing session and the parameters are applied the outgoing banner url can set banners display mobile site but not wrapper hybrid app yes when you implement smart banners wrapper hybrid app and load the banner page from the app and not from web browser don use the showbanner function this displays the banner the app alternatively use the hidebanner function traits and limitations trait remarks tablets smart banners are designed for mobile devices and their resolutions may not optimized for tablets with large screens browsers tablets may not recognized mobile devices custom parameters the following special characters are not allowed custom parameters you define parameter using one these special characters the parameter not saved banner display split appsflyer evenly splits the display active banners users not possible select which specific banners display more less for example there are banners group they each display users can changed split specific page when you set your banner group display banners specific page the banner rule applies only the host path you enter there not perfect match for example your site page has additional strings not included the rule setup the rule doesn apply name change banner group names and banner names can changed performance data isn affected and carries over"

for which clicks are already reported implementing this argument results the script not generating onelink url urlskiplist list the strings the url for particular click for example that found cause the smart script return null this can useful you use appsflyer attribution link with redirect users your mobile website and don want data from the original click lost implementing this argument results the script not generating onelink url use cases the following sections provide smart script use cases for some common campaign media source scenarios utm parameters set the script for utm parameters make list utm parameters the incoming url for example utm source and utm campaign and match them the parameters for the outgoing url for example media source and campaign provide these the list arguments the web developer result the values the incoming parameters utm source and utm campaign are used populate the values the media source and campaign parameters the outgoing link google ads gclid the usual process for install attribution google ads campaigns which carry gclid parameter requires users who click your redirected the app store page url since this case you are redirecting leads from google ads web landing page the script takes the gclid parameter from the google ads install campaign url and puts into the outgoing url your choice output parameter sub note this applies install campaigns for non aci search campaigns meaning engagement campaigns google may attributed the media source despite the smart script output gclid found the script looks for the incoming parameter keyword found puts the keyword value the outgoing url the value keywords prerequisite the google dashboard enable auto tagging with auto tagging enabled the url contains the gclid parameter set the script for google ads gclid select parameter the outgoing url contain the gclid best practice select sub that the data displays appsflyer raw data reports provide this the list arguments the web developer result the outgoing url the gclid the value the sub param notify google ads about these installs get the gclid data from the param sub via csv push api real time for every install upload the gclid data google either manually via google ads api note this gclid solution not officially supported recommended google case google deprecates the gclid parameter will change the script support the changes follow this article clicking the follow button the article header get informed when there update the article attached script facebook click facebook ads carry click ids you want this

facebook click best practice select sub that the data displays appsflyer raw data reports provide this the list arguments the web developer result the outgoing url the facebook click the value the sub param srns owned media and other media source links srns like snapchat twitter work differently than google ads cross platform like facebook campaigns from these srns lead your users the web landing page and you are billed according clicking leads unrelated any derived mobile users for these srns script setup the same for links from owned media other media sources you might use set the script make list the media source and campaign parameter names that are the incoming links provide these the list arguments the web developer the srn media source type should the media source value the incoming url and the script finds and uses the media source value the outgoing onelink url behind the download button the web landing page you want change the outgoing media source provide the incoming media source value and the override media source value the list arguments you give the web developer result for these srns media sources the values the media source and campaign parameters the incoming link are used populate the values for the media source and campaign parameters the outgoing link example incoming url https hotel incoming mediasource twitter incoming campaign big social outgoing url https hotel onelink pid twitter big social appsflyer attribution links appsflyer attribution links can used when the media source click network when you set such link appsflyer you have the option add redirection url path parameter with the desired url path your mobile website for web campaign app attribution you may not want the script create outgoing onelink url then some the data from the original click may lost action use the urlskiplist argument list the parameter result when the smart script finds the parameter the incoming link the smart script doesn produce outgoing url and the developer must decide what link place the outgoing url and implement example incoming url https app appsflyer com pid click network int orlando hotel outgoing url outgoing url desktop most use cases this article are users coming from mobile devices therefore when directed from the mobile website app store they can immediately download your app however desktop users shouldn immediately sent app store because their device desktop laptop isn compatible with mobile app downloads set the script for desktop users your onelink template set destination url for when link clicked desktop the url should redirect dedicated web landing page the landing page can contain web form where they fill their details get sms email with link download the app you create the web form and provide the url the script result the script detects the device platform the user desktop the script generates outgoing onelink url that redirects the user your dedicated web landing page see also desktop app conversion agencies installs are attributed agencies using the prt parameter add this attribution parameter using the onelink smart script tell your developer follow these instructions result the script detects the additional parameter the incoming url with the agency name and adds the prt parameter the outgoing url example incoming url https hotel incoming campaign gogo incoming media source email partner name bigagency outgoing url https hotel pid email gogo prt agency codes smart script displays code your web page instead button with link behind display code make sure you use smart script when you set your smart script tell your developer follow their instructions create code with the smart script result best practice tell the developer show the code when users are desktop and show the button with the link when users are mobile result the script displays code instead button with url behind note codes created via the smart script can customized example incoming url https hotel code html incmp gogo inmedia email outgoing url https hotel onelink ltrd web true ver pid email gogo outgoing code impressions the onelink smart script can used count impressions your website the developer needs call the impression function installs are then attributed the impressions via view through attribution note counting impressions addition the normal smart script produced url that counts clicks smart script can used count clicks impressions both view through attribution via smart script only works mobile devices not desktop attribute new installs these impressions which view through attribution make sure you use smart script when you set your smart script tell your developer call the impression function the smart script make sure view through attribution turned optional you wish change the default day view through lookback window value you your developer needs add the viewthrough lookback parameter with the new value for example viewthrough lookback important february chrome stable release google has made some changes reduce user agent data order properly get view thorough attributions using the onelink smart script you should use the onelink smart script version and above specs and limitations spec remarks uri scheme even uri scheme set the onelink template open the app for existing users for links created using smart script the parameter with the uri scheme must

the media source allocated appsflyer each integrated partner has their own unique pid value the pid ends with the int suffix when using onelink links you can set the pid any value you prefer long not reserved integrated partner avoid conflict don use the int suffix examples important integrated publisher ids organic googleadwords int google adwords facebook ads and twitter you can use any name for non integrated sources like email sms mail pigeons avoid common pid issues always include pid your attribution links without the pid the attribution link the user automatically attributed none media source and the original installation source gone for custom sources use non integrated partner pids for each integrated source use only the designated pid for the correct attribution its installs for any custom media source such email sms even viral unpaid posts facebook use other non integrated pid values use only legal characters the pid parameter the attribution link contains one the following characters the click install appears the dashboard under invalid media source name tip avoid using white spaces the pid value make sure url encode your attribution links before using them site parameter the site the unique identifier the publisher serving the other words the website app displaying the networks allocate unique site ids for each publisher this included the siteid parameter passed appsflyer the attribution link and made available via the various dashboards reporting options and postbacks the site must passed appsflyer the attribution link because provides clarity and transparency about the publisher used appsflyer identify and eliminate fraudulent publishers and other traffic clusters the site parameter only includes the the publisher that serves the include additional information such type placement both within the app for example banner interstitial video use the sub site parameter example the following attribution link includes siteid site publisher sub siteid sub site additional info this case affiliate source and type placement https app appsflyer com com yourapp pid medianame int clickid clickid advertising gaid siteid sub siteid abcd the example link publisher abcd affiliate source sub publisher that the publisher working with type placement within the app such banner interstitial video faq why does traffic result many blocked installs blocked installs can due the following missing site the siteid parameter empty the click url engagements sent with empty site signify either technical issue intentional attempt bypass fraud detection mechanisms multiple site ids the same publisher sent multiple click urls using different site ids this considered fraudulent behavior that masks the real publisher activity and often associated with click flooding site formatted incorrectly sending the wrong format combined with other fraud indications could result blocking not only the specific publisher but also higher cluster level and might impact greater volumes the partner activity avoid blocked installs make sure you send single site parameter per publisher shown the example levels data granularity you can use four url parameters deep dive into your ads performance using all parameters all your active attribution links enables you attribute all user installs and events specific ads drill down and compare the performance all your ads per set per campaign and per media source aggregated reports optimize every level compare all your ads across all media sources the raw data reports and pivot table the parameters are media source pid campaign name set adset name example the following attribution link uses levels granularity record the cashmere the coats set the winter campaign running the integrated network media source https app appsflyer com com greatapp pid networkx int winter adset coats cashmere traits and limitations trait remarks special characters the following special characters are not allowed parameter values url character limit total url length must not exceed characters faq should use lower upper case letters for parameters you can use either but you must consistent you set custom parameter with upper lower case characters make sure always use that parameter for example you set pid mymediasource make sure always use you use pid mymediasource one attribution link and pid mymediasource another discrepancies data might occur the same goes for any other param that you set the attribution link the appsflyer attribution link dynamic static attribution links can dynamic static how can you tell link dynamic static the attribution link contains parameters long pre defined attribution link and therefore static only short urls for example yourbrand onelink hat used for custom attribution links are dynamic this means that once you start using attribution link for integrated partner long url for owned media would not change for any leads engaging with even you change the attribution link values the appsflyer dashboard for the change take place you must use the new long url going forward the other hand short urls for owned media don directly contain parameters when lead engages with appsflyer short url the lead redirected appsflyer and the current set parameters take place dynamically what this play store error message you ever encounter the following error message the play store after following attribution link this because the attribution link includes character for example https app appsflyer com com travelco pid globalwide int clickid reqid usually these characters are the link because they are macros and are dynamically replaced value not really big problem and you can ignore the message what are subscriber parameters good for the subscriber parameters meaning sub sub sub can used record any useful kpis these parameters get parsed and appear the raw data report which makes them very handy for performing data aggregation filtering example hail ride app luber has creatives with color templates blue yellow and red luber mobile marketer linda wants test which color template brings more installs she adds sub blue the attribution links all the blue ads across all non srn media sources the same done for the yellow and red ads well with this information parsed and appearing the raw data reports linda able analyze the success the different colored ads and pick the best converting one what limits are there campaign names the maximum length campaign name the attribution link url limited characters exceeded the campaign name changed name exceeded max length the campaign name shouldn start from end with white space may cause discrepancies dashboards and reports"

solution click value missing from the attribution link verify that click parameter and value are included the click attribution url there correlation between the parameter defined attribution link the postback verify that the click parameters are correctly defined the click attribution url and the postback the install app event isn attributed and therefore there campaign level click data why are there missing dashboard parameters the postback reason solution the advertiser didn define any value for the dashboard parameters you have access the application setup the appsflyer dashboard integrated partners and click your logo under the integration tab find the relevant parameter and check its value not defined contact the advertiser and ask fill the value you don have the application setup ask the advertiser enable network permissions why the event data from the advertiser missing incorrect reason solution the advertiser didn correctly configure sending data appsflyer contact the advertiser and ask verify the configuration why don receive engagement postbacks reason solution engagement postback disabled appsflyer backend use the partner assistant widget and ask verify that engagement postback enabled appsflyer backend your postback template doesn have engagement identifier flag use the partner assistant widget and ask add the identifier missing retargeting parameter isn included click attribution url and therefore attribution cannot get recorded appsflyer make sure the parameter retargeting true added the click attribution url why don receive attribution postbacks reason solution your postback template doesn have the attribution identifier flag use the partner assistant widget and ask add the attribution identifier retargeting parameter isn included click attribution url and therefore reattibution cannot get recorded appsflyer make sure the parameter retargeting true added the click attribution url why don receive correct event identifiers event postbacks reason solution macro mapped iae isn integrated the app event postback use the partner assistant widget and request integrate the macro include the following information pid network email receiving parameter partner event identifier more postback macros advertiser agency didn configure the partner event identifier correctly all the click attribution url contains prt ask the agency check the partner event identifier correctly configured their dashboard not ask the advertiser check the partner event identifier correctly configured their dashboard why can see the campaign level data for non attributed traffic postbacks even the advertiser allows sending you postbacks for traffic attributed all sources appsflyer doesn share with the partners the campaign level data attributed other partners why can export reports reason solution the larger the specified date range the larger the generated file large files may require more time download specify shorter time range for the report too much browser cache can prevent the request from sending out clear browser cache and try again export the report from different browser can download report and get message that the report quota has been exceeded the number reports that can generated per day via pull api and the data export pages limited networks limitation for both pull api and the export page calls for app reports calls for non app reports networks quota counted separately from advertiser agency quotas and doesn decrease them for more information check rate limitations guide test installs don appear the dashboard you run test installs with client but don see any installs your appsflyer dashboard make sure the advertiser allowlisted the devices you are using for testing you run campaigns using probabilistic modeling ensure that your integration validated appsflyer contact your pdm install postbacks aren sent servers you believe that postbacks aren sent your servers make sure that the postback endpoint active make sure that the postback endpoint the correct one contact your pdm isn the correct endpoint app event postbacks aren sent servers app event postbacks must enabled your configuration with the advertiser ask the advertiser enable app event postbacks the advertiser grants you permissions for app events configuration make sure enable app event postbacks the integration tab the names sdk events must mapped the names events configured your own system can see app events postbacks setup agencies networks get visibility their setup done advertisers but not when done agencies therefore when agency but not the advertiser maps app events for postbacks network the network sees this section inactive although actually active for the agency example yuval the marketer the com fused app which client app the sonnet network yuval maps the purchase event sent postback sonnet when attributed user sonnet performs purchase sava agency permitted work with com fused also configures sonnet work with and maps the completeregistration event sent postback when sonnet logs into the dashboard com fused they see only the purchase event mapped with them but not the completeregistration event however when users attributed sava perform registrations the completeregistration event sent sonnet click data missing click data missing from postbacks make sure that the appsflyer link has all the data you want return you the postbacks see our attribution link guide for more information the advertiser configured the network receive all postbacks postbacks for events not attributed the network don contain click data revenue data missing revenue data missing appears the advertiser postbacks there could two possible reasons the advertiser has decided not share revenue data the advertiser has defined the app event incorrectly see installs appsflyer but not internal servers you need place the appsflyer attribution link the redirect url your servers then you need use your server own attribution link run full test make sure map the parameters your network attribution link appsflyer attribution link dashboard data missing you see data the dashboard but that data missing your servers verify that advertiser provides the necessary credentials keys when configuring the integration with your network the advertiser should add any credentials key tokens the general settings section the integration tab your network requires credentials keys for integration and the advertiser doesn provide them postbacks from appsflyer are rejected your servers data can posted your server and therefore missing data from the advertiser missing incorrect you test integration with advertiser and data installs app events available follow the suggestions below the issue happens with any advertiser contact your pdm the issue happens with only one advertiser few advertisers verify with the advertiser that they implemented the appsflyer sdk their app verify with the advertiser that the sdk implementation correct there click data discrepancy between appsflyer and our platform the clicks are shown the appsflyer dashboard they are definitely recorded appsflyer the discrepancy the numbers between appsflyer and partner data can happen for several reasons problem solution the partner platform isn recording the clicks correctly investigate the implementation your side and make the necessary fixes click capping check the dashboard your client should give you access first you can see the blocked clicks the main fraud breakdown table under blocked and capped clicks check partner account admin email for notifications about click capping single can sending multiple clicks from your servers check your implementation for this issue and make necessary fixes malicious entity sending clicks your behalf with your pid the attribution url implement click signing click deduplication user clicks multiple times appsflyer recorded one click why doesn agency account show skan data confirm that your campaign name correct view your campaigns the agency appsflyer skadnetwork dashboard the names campaigns that you configure with the skadnetwork should include your agency identifier and structured follows your prt underscore your actual campaign name that follows your agency naming convention for example your prt greatagency your campaign name may look like this greatagency streamkarxxxxxx more information skan campaigns protect how can investigate fraud from appsflyer dashboard you can check blocked data only the advertiser gives you access protect and raw data reports once the advertiser gives you the access you can download the blocked install app events reports from the export data page the dashboard more about report types raw data reports you can check the blocking reasons sub reasons filter down site see which siteids deliver high numbers fraud results then you can investigate this further with the publishers that deliver fraudulent traffic and make educated decisions about working with these publishers learn more about fraud why clicks and impressions get capped sometimes the engagements are blocked under click impressions capping they exceed our defined thresholds read more about capping you can check capped data protect dashboard the main fraud breakdown table you need the advertiser give you the access under clicks and impressions the table you can see the following data total the total amount clicks impressions respectively both fraud and legitimate blocked the number blocked clicks impressions including capped capped the number blocked clicks impressions due capping the notification the click capping also sent the admin email address the account why did test install fraud the majority the installs coming from your network are marked fraud then any new test install can get marked such for correct testing follow the process described here you should also consider stopping engaging with the publishers that drive the majority fraud can the wrong implementation the siteid parameter lead click flooding various criteria are evaluated decide whether certain traffic should blocked click flooding although this isn the only reason for click flooding sometimes incorrect implementation siteid parameter can lead blocking click flooding read more about siteid and make sure that correctly implemented"

    "text": "glance the differences between people based attribution pba and google analytics pba compared google analytics pba and google analytics are web analytics and conversion measurement solutions each focuses different measurement aspects pba also offers additional benefits pba independent unbiased attribution authority that focuses attribution measurement pba attributes conversions and revenue media sources and campaigns that bring users your website google analytics focuses more web analytics gathers analyzes and aggregates data related user behavior with google analytics you can analyze for example user behavior funnels web events benefits pba over google analytics the following are the benefits pba over google analytics pba includes web app measurement this metric tells you how many users move from your website your app also tells you which media sources and campaigns bring users your website who subsequently install your app raw data for conversions and events that you can pull into your own systems this gives you the ability and power run your analysis reasons for differences you compare data from pba and google analytics refer the following reasons for differences data sdk implementation the way you implement pba and google analytics could affect data collection google analytics shows more sessions and visitors cause google analytics loads before the web sdk users that bounce users that spend short periods time your website are not counted pba this causes discrepancies data for sessions and visitors solution strongly recommend positioning the web sdk such that loads early possible whether you load the sdk directly through google tag manager late loading the sdk can cause significant discrepancies google analytics shows more data for sessions campaign and conversions cause the web sdk present only certain pages google analytics present all pages result google analytics collects data from all over your website whereas the web sdk collects data only from certain pages this causes discrepancies data for sessions visitors campaigns and conversions solution implement the web sdk all pages your website dashboard settings dashboard settings such timezone and data filter could affect how data presented you timezone settings discrepancies data cause the timezone settings your google analytics are different from those your pba dashboard you might encounter discrepancies example your appsflyer dashboard configured utc and your dashboard configured utc this means that your dashboard ahead your appsflyer dashboard one day therefore data that appears the appsflyer dashboard for march only appears your dashboard you choose march the date range filter solution make sure time zone settings are the same both appsflyer and google analytics data filters discrepancies data issue both appsflyer and google analytics allow you filter data according date attributed media sources campaigns and events different filters appsflyer and google analytics can generate different views for the same data solution when you compare data from the two dashboards make sure filters are applied the data set conversions and events different attribution models lookback windows how you send events and cookie settings can all affect data collection and processing lookback window discrepancies conversion measurement cause you have different lookback windows google analytics and pba discrepancies might occur attribution data solution pba lookback window always days make sure set day lookback window google analytics when you choose your attribution model attribution model discrepancies conversion measurement cause different attribution models pba and google analytics can cause discrepancies attribution data solution google analytics offers default attribution models that you can choose from however pba operates last non direct touch day lookback window attribution model make sure choose last non direct touch attribution model google analytics sending events issue both google analytics sdk and the web sdk allow you send events you implement one logic for sending events google analytics and another for sending events pba discrepancies might arise solution when you send events verify the following make sure that the same trigger applies both make sure you send the event both google analytics and pba click here learn how send events using the web sdk cookies both pba and google analytics use cookies recognize users cookie settings google analytics although recommended let google analytics sdk automatically handle cookie settings you can still configure and change cookie settings any change cookie settings might cause discrepancies setting cookie expiration google analytics allows you set cookie expiry you set the google analytics cookie expire before the web sdk cookie does might cause discrepancies example mark constant visitor your website for over year now and considers subscribing premium content your developer set the google analytics cookie expire after year the web sdk however sets the cookie expire after two years when mark finally subscribes and conversion registered the google analytics cookie longer valid and another set its stead the end result that google analytics shows two users both them are mark with only one them having conversion associated with pba however shows one user for mark and the same user that has conversion associated with this means that your conversion rate google analytics lower than that pba setting cookie subdomain google analytics allows you set cookies for subdomains whereas pba only sets cookies the top level domain example you set cookie the subdomain store mywebsite com sharon visits your website and then goes your online store store mywebsite com google analytics considers her two different users since pba only sets cookies the top level domain mywebsite com considers sharon mywebsite com and store mywebsite com the same user the end result two users google analytics and one user pba"

different campaign types and attribution methods whereas skan measures installs the context paid app app campaigns typically skan metrics srn campaign installs are higher than those appsflyer because appsflyer only records consenting users the case non srn networks click networks there often much closer alignment between the metrics per framework campaign effectiveness question how many users converted and what the roi considerations determining revenue and conversion rate metrics requires that user performance measured over time skan limits measurement hours post install whereas appsflyer measurement unlimited ltv appsflyer attribution only contains metrics consenting users remedy consider whether the appsflyer attribution metrics accurately represent the entire user population including users reported via skan use them extrapolate campaign effectiveness metrics like roi and conversion rate metrics calculate the number users that converted use the appsflyer conversion rate metric per event multiply the conversion rate the actual number users derived described the campaign precision section calculate campaign revenue and roi derive the actual number users described the

pre install campaigns allow app owners reach vast audiences without running online campaigns pre install campaigns app owners can ask device manufacturers pre install their apps devices before they leave the factory pre install campaigns can also collaboration with party media sources which work with various manufacturers behalf app owners important appsflyer counts install once app launches for the first time therefore the number displayed pre installs the number users launching your app and not the number devices that have the app pre installed benefits recording installs from pre install campaigns attributing pre install campaigns you can measure the number users who launch your pre installed app number app users each manufacturer brings ltv each user and determine which manufacturer brings high value users how can measure pre install campaigns there are four ways measure pre install campaigns for more information see the setup section this article viewing pre install data pre installs appear the appsflyer dashboard under the attributed media source just like any other install event their campaign name however always pre install note you can specify different campaign names for pre installs with the sdk api method note starting may match type for factory preinstall campaigns displayed preload conf raw data reports appsflyer displays dashboards the network that drove the preload and networks that contributed the first app launch learn more about preload campaigns setup select from one the following methods measure pre install campaigns method name requires multiple apks guarantees pre install attribution requires action from media source manufacturer system properties yes yes sdk api yes name manifest file yes path way yes system properties method recommended use sdk version this method recommended because the most robust all however consider that for all subsequent app installs the pre install media source always attributed this regardless whether the install new reinstall the system properties method requires actions both the developer and the manufacturer side developer you need provide the manufacturer media source with the apk the default apk provided this method doesn require separate apk create file called pre install appsflyer the file add key value pair package name media source for example com appsflyer sampleapp huawei specify additional pre install parameters the pre install appsflyer file pass the additional parameters json format for example com appsflyer sampleapp pid huawei special campaign adset some adset important important note the following behavior when using this option raw data sets channel pre install the pid parameter not present the json the media source appears none raw data the json configuration the parameter not present then the campaign name set pre install the json malformed the passed string treated the media source name once you have the pre install appsflyer file give the media source manufacturer together with the apk manufacturer the manufacturer places the pre install appsflyer file path its choosing the pre install appsflyer file permissions should set the manufacturer then edits the system properties file order point the pre install appsflyer file the manufacturer needs add key value pair system properties note root permissions are required for this step root permissions are also required when testing preinstall configuration see the testing section for more details adding key value pair android system properties adb shell setprop appsflyer preinstall path data pre install appsflyer alternative method retrieve the system properties file from the android file system edit and push back adb root adb remount adb pull system build prop echo appsflyer preinstall path data pre install appsflyer build prop adb push build prop system build prop adb shell chmod system build prop adb reboot advantages need maintain different apks for each media source manufacturer need make changes and add paths the app google play manufacturers can use custom paths and there are dependencies between multiple preinstalled apps running different devices this method ensures attribution preinstall campaigns and media sources even user updates the app before launching installs the app after clicking the preinstall still attributed the preinstall media source manufacturer disadvantages some responsibility transferred over the media source manufacturer the developers need sure that the manufacturer media source takes the necessary steps moreover this method might little harder for the app developer test sdk api method the sdk api method provides native way specify the manufacturer media source name which the pre install attributed use this method add the following method call the afapplication class before initializing the sdk setpreinstallattribution string mediasource string campaign string siteid when working with media source appsflyerlib getinstance setpreinstallattribution media source name campaign name appsflyerlib getinstance init dev key conversionlistener getapplicationcontext when working with manufacturer appsflyerlib getinstance setpreinstallattribution android build manufacturer campaign name appsflyerlib getinstance init dev key conversionlistener getapplicationcontext note the media source parameter mandatory the android build manufacturer property holds the manufacturer name configured the operating system using this property doesn guarantee that you get the manufacturer name the same format across devices from that manufacturer make sure that this property holds the manufacturer name expected the campaign and siteid parameters are optional but are required the setpreinstallattribution method you don want specify campaign and siteid pass null both advantages the sdk api method lets you retrieve the manufacturer name programmatically matter the manufacturer the sdk method retrieves the name directly from the device this means that you can maintain one apk for all manufacturers that you collaborate with the setpreinstallattribution method allows you specify the campaign name you can separate each manufacturer media source into different campaigns rather than have all them set under the pre install campaign disadvantages you are working directly with manufacturers you have maintain two versions your apk one for manufacturers and another for google play either case more than one apk required you are working with several media sources that communicate with the manufacturer your behalf you need maintain separate apk for each media source some cases the install might not attributed the pre install media source user with new device updates the pre installed app directly from google play without first launching the install considered organic user with new device updates the app from google play after clicking the install attributed the media source that serves the tip you can implement logic the app make sure that the install counted pre install even the scenarios above take place both the play store apk and the apk intended for pre install should contain that logic example you know that apps are pre installed devices given manufacturer and model these devices are also running with given carrier when the app launches you can check for these conditions when the app launches these conditions are met the install recorded pre install since the logic also exists the play store apk the install recorded pre install even the user updates the app before launching name manifest file method the name the manifest method requires you add metadata tag the app manifest file you need repeat this step for every media source manufacturer that you collaborate with add metadata tag before the closing application tag meta data android name pre install name android value market name application manifest when the app launches for the first time the appsflyer sdk detects this metadata tag the manifest file and attributes the install accordingly advantages the name the manifest method considered easy method for attributing pre install campaigns there only one tag add the manifest addition the media source manufacturer doesn have anything their end order enable campaign measuring disadvantages since the metadata tag specifies the media source manufacturer name you need maintain different sets apks one for each media source manufacturer some cases the install might not attributed the pre install media source user with new device updates the pre installed app directly from google play without first launching the install considered organic user with new device installs the app from google play after clicking the install attributed the media source that serves the pathway method note supported sdk version later this method requires both the developer and the manufacturer perform some actions their end developer the pathway method allows you specify path file that holds the name the media source manufacturer there are three steps that you need complete create file that contains key value pair the file should called pre install appsflyer the file specify the key value pair the format package name media source for example com appsflyer sampleapp media source passing additional pre install parameters you can specify additional pre install parameters the file using json for example you can add the following key value pair the pre install appsflyer file com appsflyer sampleapp pid huawei special campaign adset some adset important important note the following behaviors when using this option sets pre install channel pid not present the json the media source appears none the json configuration not present then the campaign name set pre install the json malformed the passed string treated the media source name once you have the pre install appsflyer file give the media source manufacturer together with the apk talk the media source manufacturer and agree with them path where they put the file the recommended path data local tmp pre install appsflyer once path agreed upon specify the manifest file place the following snippet before the closing application tag meta data android name pre install path android value data local temp pre install appsflyer manufacturer the manufacturer needs put the file the path that agreed upon the pre install appsflyer file permissions should set once the app launches the sdk looks inside the manifest file sees the specified path and looks for the file there when finds attributes the install according the media source that specified advantages appsflyer looks for the pre install appsflyer file two default paths data local tmp pre install appsflyer etc pre install appsflyer some manufacturers prefer put the file non default path such case you can specify this non default path the manifest file important non default path requires sdk version later although non default paths are allowed recommend implementing the system properties method instead disadvantages you need maintain separate pre install appsflyer files for different media sources manufacturers the manufacturer might want put the pre install appsflyer file non default path this case you need maintain separate apks for each non default path non default path used the install might not attributed the pre install media source user with new device updates the pre installed app directly from google play without first launching the install considered organic user with new device installs the app from google play after clicking the install attributed the media source that serves the testing pre install configuration this section demonstrates how test and verify your pre install configuration important before you start testing make sure allowlist the devices you are using for testing also make sure set the debug log true the afapplication class appsflyerlib getinstance setdebuglog true verifying the configuration the app tip avoid caching issues and for best results recommended that you clean the project before building android studio click build the context menu and choose clean project build your application android studio and install the test device once the application launches open the logcat android studio and filter appsflyer you should see the attributed install with all the details see the screenshots below for illustration verifying the configuration the appsflyer dashboard the configuration successful non organic install that attributed manufacturer media source appears the dashboard the install event also listed under the pre install campaign head over your appsflyer account and open the dashboard for the app that you are testing follow the steps below the overview page filter media sources and choose the media source the breakdown campaign graph you can see that the install that attributed media source comes from pre install campaign you can also verify that the install attributed correctly viewing the aggregated performance report you can see the media source and campaign see the screenshot below where media source the media source and the campaign pre install repeat the process for all manufacturers media sources that you collaborate with for pre install campaigns special cases multiple pre install apps the same device you have campaigns for several apps that are installed the same device you can measure attribution using each the four methods name manifest method for each app specify the media source manufacturer the manifest xml each app sdk api method for each app specify the media source manufacturer the sdk api method for pre install for system properties pathway methods can specify the apps and their corresponding media source the pre install appsflyer file each app info should added new line the file for example com appsflyer tester market name com newapp newapp market name com game king market name sending install postbacks the media source manufacturer that you collaborate with appsflyer partner you can enable postbacks for installs make sure that the media source name equivalent the media source pid configured appsflyer for example you are collaborating with market name its pid market name int you can see the pid examining the attribution link integrated partner agencies currently agencies cannot attributed with pre installs the prt parameter for agency name part the pre install data and the user launches the pre installed app the user attributed the media source used the agency pid the client can access the full user level data the user not attributed the agency the agency can access the user level data"

manager role she can later moved back temp role diana was the last user temp role when you moved her the team manager role temp role will longer appear your account changing the account owner because all admins have the same permissions the account owner changing the account owner not usually necessary but you find that you must change the account owner follow these steps important few things

data recording during session how for the session opt out scenario the first sdk call comes after the user agrees refuses that data sent from their device the user agrees send data the start method should called the user refuses that data sent don call start data sent appsflyer depends the opt out status each session follows opt out session data sent opt session all session data sent note attribution data sent the first time the user opts example com adultsplay casual gaming app for adults over years old doesn require users register but does require their confirmation age with every new launch sessions where the users confirm they over get the full gaming experience and are recorded while otherwise recording carried out dev the developer added flag called tracking which becomes true only for sessions that confirm age this flag true the start method called otherwise start isn called one time opt out when anytime gdpr what the app owner collects attribution and post install data the user requests stop further collection data for example compliance with gdp request gdpr how don call start and then directly call stop instead the first launch use the start method with the requestlistener upon successful completion the callback function call stop all the following sessions don call start data sent appsflyer install and session data sent appsflyer data sent appsflyer after the stop method called example com watchmegrow plant growth viewing app where users watch growing plants and mobile ads the app owner wants keep all app activities data secret the first launch dev the developer calls start method with the requestlistener when receiving successful completion calls stop from the callback function and sets persistent parameter first launch false following launches dev checks first launch false and then skips start code sample example here record install and anonymize when upon the first launch what the app owner wants collect all attribution data and then wants collect all subsequent information such app events sessions data unattributed organic data post installation all device ids are anonymized when sent appsflyer from the sdk how don call start and then directly call stop instead the first launch use the start method with the requestlistener upon successful completion the callback function call anonymizeuser true data sent appsflyer install complete attribution data sent appsflyer after install app events data and session data are sent appsflyer without attribution data upon receipt the user identifier anonymized and the appsflyer and address are hashed the following image shows example anonymized and hashed data example the app owner the com munistic app believes all users are born equal and prefers see all their post install actions organic only the first launch dev the developer calls start method with the requestlistener when receiving successful completion calls anonymizeuser true from the callback function code sample example here opting out retargeting campaigns consider excluding opted out users from retargeting campaigns these users are likely complain about being retargeted having opted out when manually running retargeting campaigns targeted active users make sure remove the opted out users from the lists sent media sources lists alternately you using appsflyer audiences build your audience lists and send them media sources opted out users are excluded from the lists sent media sources stop api and deep linking using the stop api stops all external communication the appsflyer sdk embedded the app therefore after calling stop shortened links are longer decoded the appsflyer sdk this means that any shortened link does not generate the call onappopenattribution and deep linking isn performed correctly your app has relatively high percentage opted out users and you plan some retargeting campaigns for your users use long links and avoid using shortened links restarting the sdk function when opted out user agrees opt call the start method restart the sdk and begin recording attribution data strict mode sdk ios only sometimes developers prefer submit their apps without any reference the adsupport framework and idfa collection their code such cases use the strict mode sdk"

depending regulatory and user requirements follow the appropriate flow using opt out scenario detailed this ensure compliance with opt out requests and order continue collecting attribution data where appropriate scenarios where opt out enabled the appsflyer hashed scenarios opt out installation when upon the first launch example coppa compliance what the app requires the user agreement perform event recording during all sessions the user consents recording for example user above certain age the app calls the sdk start method otherwise the start method should not called caution don use stop start was never called how the start method should always called the session start opted users but shouldn called for opted out users addition app events cannot sent for users who have never opted they are regarded coming from unknown users and organic therefore for apps recommend that enable installation opt out has permanent flag parameter that shows start was called beforehand not this flag should always checked before calling start logevent methods are called data sent appsflyer data sent the user subsequently opts attribution and session data are sent from the time start called example com carefulapp requires users register upon installing the form includes checkbox over age dev the developer added flag called tracking which becomes true only for registrations that have this box checked and then activates start code sample example here prevent data sharing with third parties when every time the sdk initialized what user can request opt out sharing their data with parties activating this option the appsflyer sdk before the first start call the following applies the whole session users from srns are attributed organic and their data not shared with integrated partners users from click networks non srns are attributed correctly appsflyer but not shared with the networks via postbacks apis raw data reports any other method how prevent event data sharing via sdk android ios starting with sdk prevent one more specified media sources all media sources from receiving the event use setsharingfilterforpartners sdk method api send the sharing filter parameter data sent appsflyer data sent and stored appsflyer but never shared with appsflyer integrated partners example com california travel app for california theme parks ccpa compliant resident california submits opt out request the app notifies appsflyer not share the user event data with third parties session opt out when every app launch what all app sessions require user agreement perform event and data recording during session how for the session opt out scenario the first sdk call comes after the user agrees refuses that data sent from their device the user agrees send data the start method should called the user refuses that data sent don call start data sent appsflyer depends the opt out status each session follows opt out session data sent opt session all session data sent note attribution data sent the first time the user opts example com adultsplay casual gaming app for adults over years old doesn require users register but does require their confirmation age with every new launch sessions where the users confirm they over get the full gaming experience and are recorded while otherwise recording carried out dev the developer added flag called tracking which becomes true only for sessions that confirm age this flag true the start method called otherwise start isn called one time opt out when anytime gdpr what the app owner collects attribution and post install data the user requests stop further collection data for example compliance with gdp request gdpr how don call start and then directly call stop instead the first launch use the start method with the requestlistener upon successful completion the callback function call stop all the following sessions don call start data sent appsflyer install and session data sent appsflyer data sent appsflyer after the stop method called example com watchmegrow plant growth viewing app where users watch growing plants and mobile ads the app owner wants keep all app activities data secret the first launch dev the developer calls start method with the requestlistener when receiving successful completion calls stop from the callback function and sets persistent parameter first launch false following launches dev checks first launch false and then skips start code sample example here record install and anonymize when upon the first launch what the app owner wants collect all attribution data and then wants collect all subsequent information such app events sessions data unattributed organic data post installation all device ids are anonymized when sent appsflyer from the sdk how don call start and then directly call stop instead the first launch use the start method with the requestlistener upon successful completion the callback function call anonymizeuser true data sent appsflyer install complete attribution data sent appsflyer after install app events data and session data are sent appsflyer without attribution data upon receipt the user identifier anonymized and the appsflyer and address are hashed the following image shows example anonymized and hashed data example the app owner the com munistic app believes all users are born equal and prefers see all their post install actions organic only the first launch dev the developer calls start method with the requestlistener when receiving successful completion calls anonymizeuser true from the callback function code sample example here opting out retargeting campaigns consider excluding opted out users from retargeting campaigns these users are likely complain about being retargeted having opted out when manually running retargeting campaigns targeted active users make sure remove the opted out users from the lists sent media sources lists alternately you using appsflyer audiences build your audience lists and send them media sources opted out users are excluded from the lists sent media sources stop api and deep linking using the stop api stops all external communication the appsflyer sdk embedded the app therefore after calling stop shortened links are longer decoded the appsflyer sdk this means that any shortened link does not generate the call onappopenattribution and deep linking isn performed correctly your app has relatively high percentage opted out users and you plan some retargeting campaigns for your users use long links and avoid using shortened links restarting the sdk function when opted out user agrees opt call the start method restart the sdk and begin recording attribution data strict mode sdk ios only sometimes developers prefer submit their apps

events conversion events provide insights into your marketing and business efforts conversion events include purchases downloads signups and subscriptions pba attributes conversion events the media source that drove the user visit the website identifying the attributed media source you can measure and differentiate the quality users brought different media sources conversion events are used record revenue and calculate roi use them compare the budget ads for specific media sources against the revenue generated from the users that come from these media sources standard events standard events are used validate the user journey and funnels that lead conversions use them measure user activity and highlight media sources that bring engaged users record user activity mark users for engagement campaigns recording events trigger the web sdk record events when certain conditions are met for example when landing page loads when users interact with website elements see examples recording events identifying users using customer user cuid web users are identified appsflyer using the unique cuid you allocate them typically the cuid managed your backend servers use the same cuid value you use the mobile environment doing enables you have holistic view user activity across multiple platforms the function the mobile sdk setcustomeruserid function ios android unity set the cuid the web sdk set the cuid the earliest point that you have access most times this means you need wait for the user identify via login sign fire the javascript call setcustomeruserid shown the example that follows note send the cuid string even number enclosing quotation marks you implement web consider that you may need notify pba when you associate cuid with web visitor your backend cuids must not contain directly identifiable personal information such phone number email address example set the cuid associate all current user web events distinct pba setcustomeruserid web sdk event

identifier generated appsflyer installation this appears all events recorded appsflyer new generated app deleted and then reinstalled customer user cuid unique user identifier usually generated and set the app owner the time user registration using cuid map data requires that your app configured send the cuid appsflyer via the sdk the server server api platform app app using this option allows you map any the following identifiers for ios apps idfa idfv for android apps gaid android important you map platform key identifier you must also map column one the report custom sources the app event data identifier app the app the unique case sensitive identifier that identifies your app the appsflyer dashboard generally set the app store which your app located and appears the url address

mapping schemes direct indirect the report includes more than one custom source only one them needs mapped directly app event key identifier other custom sources can mapped either directly indirectly illustrated the following example example the scenario shown above custom source identifier mapped directly the app event key identifier custom source mapped indirectly user code custom source mapped indirectly through longer chain user user code custom source identifier mapped directly the app event key identifier note that could have been mapped indirectly instead through custom source identifier user but either option works fine this mapping scheme works match data among all the sources since each custom source mapped either directly indirectly the app event key identifier determine treatment multiple matching events only for reports containing custom sources many cases the app event data will include more than one event during the selected timeframe with the same key identifier when this the case you must instruct the dcr which matching events should include the report matching all events the most comprehensive matching method allows your report include all matching events order achieve this result you must map identifier one the report custom sources the app event data identifier install time the identifier your source that mapped install time must the following format yyyy note though the name the app event data identifier install time actually means event time matching single event you not map identifier install time you must elect use either the last first matching event your report last event the app event included the report the last event chronologically the timeframe that matches specific key identifier first event the app event included the report the first event chronologically the timeframe that matches specific key identifier make this selection based the event you consider most relevant the insights you want obtain from the

the decision making insights you need aggregating grouping the data the dimensions you choose dimension generally attribute which you categorize app users for example geo install date campaign etc extracting dimensions from event value when app events are reported appsflyer via the sdk the api much the raw data contained single field called event value this structured data field includes all

dimension regrouping depending the size your data set the number dimensions you choose and other factors possible that report would include one more groups only user reporting the data this way would violate restrictions against providing user level data however instead removing hiding the data from the report completely the dcr uses regrouping mechanism provide much detail possible while maintaining user privacy regrouping example assume you have set report according the following dimensions order app event dimensions media source campaign adset name custom source dimensions user type before regrouping after initial analysis the data the dcr determines that the data would break down follows mediasource campaign adsetname adid usertype revd revd count reportable facebook ads green kjh buyer facebook ads green jkj ultra facebook ads green lkh beg facebook ads green ilk beg facebook ads green plm beg stands the final three rows are not reportable because each row contains only user according the regrouping logic the dcr first eliminates the last listed app event dimension which this case then analyzes the data again see which rows are reportable after regrouping after applying the regrouping logic the report appears follows mediasource campaign adsetname adid usertype revd revd count reportable facebook ads green kjh buyer facebook ads green jkj ultra facebook ads green restricted beg results the last row now combines the data that had previously been rows the combined row now has user count greater than and can reported the dimension that was eliminated now

purchase destination and revenue predefined and custom events app events that you want send require your developer implement code where applicable your app event names and event parameters are classified follows predefined these are event names and event parameters that are commonly used among different apps highly recommend using predefined event names and event parameters much possible for the following reasons predefined naming allows automatic mapping events partners appsflyer decides change the name any event event parameter your implementation backward compatible custom these are event names and parameters that you define for specific user scenarios that occur your app you can use any custom event name parameter name string but keep mind that custom events need maintenance your developer see tips and limitations revenue events whenever you send app events such purchase flight booking you send with its associated revenue the sole parameter that carries revenue app events

the range this value should the equivalent original currency amount values outside this range are included raw data reports but not aggregate reports revenue can also bear negative revenue values you need record events such canceled transactions refunds note not format the revenue value any way should not contain comma separators currency special characters text revenue value should similar for example appsflyer provides revenue value with precision five decimal places appsflyer displays the exact revenue sent from the sdk does not include any calculations for vat app store commissions etc unless these were included the developer the sdk side prior being sent appsflyer currency represents the currency that stated revenue price currency missing from the event parameters appsflyer sends

events currency using currency conversion the diagram above demonstrates the following process app events are sent different currency for each event appsflyer normalizes all currencies usd appsflyer processes revenue data revenue data the dashboard displayed app settings currency appsflyer populates revenue data raw data reports both event and app settings currency appsflyer uses open exchange rates for currency conversion the exchange rate updated hourly basis whenever appsflyer performs currency conversion uses the exchange rate the last hourly update currency conversion example your app

common way send events you can send rich app events that record user actions the app using the appsflyer app events api the sdk level sever server api use the server server api send events that occur outside the mobile app directly appsflyer for example you have user who active both web and mobile interfaces you can record events from both sources and attribute them the same user appsflyer can either app event other events such website events call center events purchases your brick and mortar store receipt validation this secure mechanism where the payment platform for example apple and google validate that the app purchase took place reported validating purchases the primary tool prevent fraudulent revenue events also helps you see what the real revenue and filters out incomplete app purchases hybrid apps these apps combine native views and html content and can also record app events however because the sdk can only send events from the native side developers have forward all event data native code setting app events the process setting app events requires that the marketer and the developer work together follows step role task details marketer determine the app events that you want measure define and communicate the event names and event parameters your developer recommended start with events that you can use kpis measure the quality your users for example purchases registration and sharing event parameters are optional and you can use any event parameter with any event name see recommended events business vertical for typical app events developer

level score arena char type paladin note that raw data reporting premium feature tips keep mind the following when defining event names and parameters the app for data consistency raw data reporting recommend defining and using the same app event names and structures across all platforms use minimal number events make easier compare the quality users coming from different sources important that you ensure the privacy your users don populate app event values with restricted data that can directly identify them for example email address name identity number and some locations postal code for more information about restricted data read the services privacy policy note that appsflyer collects the address devices during engagements some jurisdictions use scenarios the address can regarded pii use the address derive the broad geographic location city district level the device but not the specific address needed you can select mask addresses that they don appear raw data reports app events are the only source revenue data appsflyer you can attach specific revenue value each event and view your app dashboard learn more about the monetizing parameters limitations keep mind the following when defining event names and parameters the app recommend using only lower case alpha numeric characters and for your app event names event names are case sensitive meaning that purchase and purchase are two different events the raw data however aggregate reports for example overview events they can displayed single event there cardinality limit unique events per day learn more unique users are only counted for the first events after they install the app event names cannot begin with these characters event names cannot contain empty spaces you can use underlined spaces low dashes before after the name the event event values should not exceed characters you include the referring url event value must url encoded facebook has some limitations regarding event names and parameters read about the limitations here faq the following section includes various faq about app events how use the revenue parameter you can send revenue values with any parameter name and event however register the revenue including negative revenue the appsflyer raw and aggregated data you must use the revenue parameter always use with app events that represent actual revenue generation your business logic currency represents the currency that stated revenue price currency missing from the event parameters appsflyer sends with the default value usd for more information about the revenue parameter see the revenue attribution guide how does appsflyer attribute events app events are attributed the original media source the app install upon the install app first app launch appsflyer uses various attribution methods determine the attribution the install the same time the appsflyer sdk creates new unique appsflyer which associated with the attribution details every consequent app event performed the same device the app has this this enables appsflyer attribute the event the original media source advertisers can use this follow the full user journey their app events recently retargeted users may have double attribution appsflyer attributes events attributed installs organic when more than months pass after the install date the media source terms dictate deleting the user level data the user deletes the app stored data the device forcing the creation new appsflyer are events recorded device offline user initiates event when the internet connection unavailable appsflyer still able record this how works sdk sends the events the appsflyer servers and waits for successful response the sdk doesn receive successful response the event stored the cache once the next successful response received the stored event sent the server again there are multiple events the cache they are sent the server one after the other note the sdk cache can store events which means that only the first events that happen offline are saved everything that follows until the next successful response gets discarded the event time that displays the raw data the time the event sent appsflyer after the device goes online again not the actual time that the event takes place what are complex app events and how set them complex app events enable sending multiple events single api call they are useful when you want see several closely related user actions grouped together for example adding several products the basket single session example revenue currency usd receipt product content price quantity content price quantity content price quantity content price quantity content price quantity caution complex app events cause postback issues with facebook and criteo you need the event fully mapped with facebook and criteo send separate events per user action for example send add cart event per each added item use the app events raw data group these events together can add multiple items single transaction you can add multiple items single transaction instead single values per event parameter you can have array items describing the transaction separated commas the format should json string example the same transaction smith purchases two identical shirts one pair shoes and hat from based online store the sequence which each item listed must identical for each parameter content quantity price revenue currency usd multiple items are sent onward array postbacks currently facebook and twitter can parse array parameters correctly assist with this issue appsflyer sums the number items quantity instead sending these srns array our example facebook would get quantity note multiple items can used with the following app events add cart add wishlist tutorial completion initiated checkout purchase rate spent credits content view travel booking update how does appsflyer handle event deduplication have app event deduplication mechanism checks all app events see there was identical app event that came from the same appsflyer less than seconds beforehand such event found the mechanism removes the duplicate two events are considered identical the following fields both events are the same event name event value app appsflyer note deduplication works only for app events which are sent from the sdk app events don get deduplicated how long does appsflyer retain user level data and what are the deletion obligations appsflyer retains user level raw data for months except where otherwise directed required allowed law some srns partners require attribution providers including appsflyer delete srn partner related user level data before the expiry the month period after deletion events related deleted users display organic past aggregate data not changed for more information see data retention and deletion obligations need add the operating system parameter events the android sdk and ios sdk automatically add the operating system parameter

names per day are available day all event information from the event and above attributed the event name called exceeded events limit tip stop seeing exceeded events limit consider using rich app events instead reporting hundreds different events define small number general event names ideally use dynamic event values differentiate between these events this lets you optimize according value parameters and perform analysis based the event values which are available via the app events raw data report validation rules remove unneeded app events from the appsflyer platform example your app com greatapp sends purchase app event for every color socks sells for example buy red socks buy blue socks buy white socks etc avoid this inflation different events narrow them all down single event buy socks and insert the color event parameter exceeded keywords limit unique keywords per day per media source are available day keyword information from the keyword and above grouped the exceeded

source exceeded siteid limit unique site ids per day per media are available day site information from the site and above per media source grouped into single site titled exceeded siteid limit therefore you see the site exceeded siteid limit means there are too many used site ids per the media source question and trying optimize the source traffic according site ids becomes less accurate and less effective tip divide and conquer instead using thousands site ids per media source which distort your aggregate data use second parameter your attribution links called sub siteid define small number general site ids ideally and assign all previous site ids sub site ids under these general site ids this enables you prevent seeing exceeded siteid limit efficiently optimize according significant site ids traffic perform deep analysis based the site ids and sub site ids the raw data note the retention report you not see exceeded siteid limit but not all the site ids are shown site ids are shown randomly but limitation show all when they have exceeded the limit work around this issue retrieve retention data from the master api how avoid getting exceeded sources the long term solution most advertisers won encounter exceeded sources they don normally define campaigns manually you encounter exceeded sources probably because one more media sources using dynamic values for names campaigns site ids sets ads dynamic app events within the app code may cause the exceeded events limit source data appear tip use only static values for names app events campaigns site ids sets and ads avoid getting exceeded sources also please check specific tips per any exceeded source above the short term solution the long term solution may take you few days few weeks fully implement but what you want look your data right now explained exceeded source occurs when appsflyer receives the click event source during single day possible that the more prominent media sources you use arrive later the day and therefore are combined with exceeded source data here simple trick minimize the effect any exceeded source you see tip forget today and look only data from yesterday and beforehand every day aggregation process recalculates the last day data and retrospect assigns only the smallest not most late sources any exceeded source this ensures that the distortion caused the overflow clicks minimal"

default when you create onelink templates and set universal links and app links these files are generated and hosted appsflyer uri schemes the primary method for opening apps samsung devices otherwise legacy and fallback method for opening apps can used for android users with versions prior less than android users fallback for when universal links and app links don open the app either because they don work aren set note using uri schemes fallback for universal links subject ios based limitations learn more deep linking universal links app links and uri schemes are secure methods for opening app deep link and redirect users into specific activities pages the app follow the onelink deep linking instructions which operating systems allow uri schemes open the app uri schemes work open the app ios yes use fallback for universal links failure important notes using uri schemes fallback subject ios based limitations for many browsers including safari you must add the force deeplink true parameter the url use uri schemes fallback learn more android yes use for samsung devices android versions prior and fallback for when app links fail later android versions amazon windows mobile need update the app after ios universal links and android app links setup yes whenever universal links app links are implemented open the app for existing users ios associated domains androidmanifest xml updated this means that you must upload new version the app the relevant app store tip minimize the need for app updates make all the dev related changes required open the app and deep link one time can redirect existing users web page instead the app yes however configuring your template affects all users new and existing and sends everyone the landing page web url meaning new users are not sent the app store send users web page your template not set universal links app links uri scheme set the redirections for when the app isn installed the landing page web url the landing page web urls are added the values for the android url and ios url parameters the redirections are then automatically applied for when the app installed for existing users well note you want redirect existing users mobile web page only after app launch your app developer must configure that behavior can redirect tablet users different app url then mobile app users you can set specific redirections for windows phones ipads amazon kindle fire other tablets are not currently supported for separate redirection can assign app multiple onelink templates yes while you can use single onelink template create limitless number onelink urls some cases might necessary assign app more than one onelink template for example you have multiple versions android app for out store markets you may need separate onelink template for each android version with the same ios app assigned all them important for templates using ios universal links and android app links open the app your templates have different subdomains you need configure and update your ios and android apps for each one ios universal links after creating the new onelink template and updating the associated domain the app submit new version the app store only ios users who have updated the new version can activate onelink url built the new template android app links after creating the new onelink template copy the xml snippet the bottom the app link section and add the androidmanifest xml file inside the intent you want deep link into addition any previous intents release the new version the store only android users who have updated the new version can activate onelink url built the new template can delete onelink template yes but only contacting your csm sending email our customer engagement team hello appsflyer com note you have existing onelink urls based the deleted template they won work even get users the app store for this reason particularly important that you don delete template without first making sure that there are onelink urls using alternatively consider possible achieve the results you need changing the existing template configuration instead deleting can change the subdomain onelink template yes long there are existing custom links appsflyer based the template there are already custom links appsflyer based the onelink template then the subdomain can changed this limitation designed prevent breaking the redirection deep linking behavior live links you need change the subdomain template with existing custom links you can either create new onelink template with the new subdomain and create links based delete all existing custom links based the template for which the subdomain needs changed once all links based the template have been deleted the subdomain becomes editable can the domain subdomain onelink template applied the template another template taking the subdomain domain configured specific template and template and manually concatenating different template breaks the

note your link contains web appsflyer does not register click when comes from desktop tip try redirecting desktop users web url that contains dedicated web form that sends onelink url the mobile device the desktop user via sms email learn more about this option part the onelink smart script solution how can redirect chrome users apps chromebooks are considered android apps for chromebook redirect new users without your app installed different web url the onelink template settings under set link behavior when app isn installed android click change different url orin the onelink link settings under deep linking redirection redirect when app isn installed android select web url enter the url when added via the link settings the url added your link the android url parameter onelink link faq does onelink work without the appsflyer sdk yes but only part you need convert mobile web visitors into mobile users fast and can integrate the appsflyer sdk possible basic user redirection and app launching work even appsflyer sdk isn yet integrated into the app smart banners don require the sdk either and also work fine without however the absence the sdk means that clicking users can deep linked beyond the initial app launch attribution data isn recorded app events aren recorded what methods are available for creating onelink custom links the following table compares the different methods available for creating onelink custom links link creation method uses short long url premium feature visible attribution ttl time live max and default appsflyer create onelink template and custom links both ttl onelink api create thousands onelinks quickly short days onelink bulk link creation create thousands onelinks short urls quickly using the parameters defined csv short days sdk user invite referral campaigns short days onelink smart script mobile web app campaigns long ttl spreadsheet create thousands onelink custom links applying your own formulas long ttl can onelink custom links open the app from browser yes but aware that universal links and app links only work when clicked for example when clicking link web page email pasting the link the browser address bar doesn launch the app test your links clicking urls not pasting them the browser url box why doesn the onelink url open the app deep link existing users despite the best intentions some cases your onelink urls may not perform the intended deep linking when this happens instead opening the app getting deep linked into specific activity within the app users are redirected the app store error page there are several possible reasons for this host applications apps which your attribution links are shared for example whatsapp gmail wechat use different methods activate clicked links such proprietary internal browsers some these are known block all attribution links browsers certain browsers and platforms behave differently with links certain browsers for example pasting link does not work the link must actually clicked updates new updates both ios and android may introduce unexpected bugs that hamper deep linking devices different smartphones tablets laptops and other devices running different versions ios android windows mobile and other operating systems can vary greatly their handling attribution links misconfiguration the use special characters the deep linking value breaks the link two solutions for improving the user experience are fallback urls and forced deep linking fallback urls fallback urls send users specified web pages opening the app deep linking fails for any reason caution they also send users without your app installed the fallback url instead the correct app store sure only use this option you retargeting users with your app already installed implement fallback url the onelink template custom link settings set the link behavior for when the app isn installed redirect different url using this setting adds ios url and android url destination parameters for the fallback which will cause ios users redirected the page specified ios url and android users redirected the page specified android url example consider for example the following onelink url https onelink qwerty pid source greatapp ios url www yoursite com ios bonus android url www yoursite com android bonus both ios and android users who click this link should deep linked into the app however when deep linking fails users are redirected follows ios www yoursite com ios bonus android www yoursite com android bonus note you include hash symbol part parameter value the url you need encode when redirection occurs onelink url parameters pass through the destination page specified ios url android url prevent this behavior add the parameter param forwarding false the onelink forced deep linking forced deep linking allows you use uri scheme fallback open the app and deep link users this solution works well for most users who have the app installed however for ios using uri scheme open the app has limitations and you may need add force deeplink true the onelink url force deep linking into the activity specified the uri scheme the parameter learn more about uri scheme fallback for ios why does onelink url open blank page chrome make sure you are not using html tag that includes the target attribute the onelink url placed inside tag with the target blank attribute opens blank page chrome both ios and android and the user not redirected the app store google play can use onelink for redirection brave yes however android when user clicks onelink link brave browser deferred deep linking doesn work and ios after the user clicks they see blank screen and deferred deep linking only works they then something the blank screen for example scroll tap onelink custom links take longer load than other links onelink custom links not add any extra processing load time function properly and redirect users required they just fast any other appsflyer links how can record the cost per install when using onelink turning enable cost per install under advanced parameters allows you apply specific cpi value each install coming from the link select the cost currency and then numeric only value with digits after the decimal point representing the cpi this adds the parameters cost currency and cost value the link example sms campaign costs per messages cpm experience has shown that your campaigns achieve conversion rate meaning the derived cpi setting the cost per install usd allows you measure the eventual roi the sms campaign learn more about measuring cost and roi how can prevent parameter forwarding redirections ios url android url and web carry over parameters from the attribution link onelink the redirected page prevent this

will break the app opening functionality universal links and app links order activate universal links app links the needs recognize the domain the url associated with the app and any type external wrapping shortening redirecting the user facing link makes this impossible this includes using bit non appsflyer branded links email service providers esps with click recording enabled wrap shorten link way that allows the redirection work properly use the short urls generated appsflyer when you create onelink custom links instead external shorteners like bit tip make the url even shorter creating short branded domain your link and you creating the links the appsflyer you can edit the url short possible example https brand com where brand com your branded domain the template which always characters and the url which can edited down character benefits this method works because uses the onelink subdomain configured the onelink template enables you change parameters the fly including any deep linking settings even after distributing the attribution links your leads counts all the clicks from mobile devices the appsflyer dashboard you don need check another service the last part the short url can customized make branded domain use the uri scheme fallback open the app when universal links and app links fail and add the following parameter the link force deeplink true see options for working with esps can use onelink custom links emails yes but requires special consideration when you working with email service providers esps order count performed clicks esps wrap all links placed inside emails this breaks the app opening deep linking flow for users who click the url prevent this use one the following optional solutions disable click recording your esp configuration tip this generally the easiest solution force the app open with the uri scheme specified the parameter adding the flag esp true the attribution link this solution works well for users who have the app installed use esps that support the appsflyer solution for app opening and deep linking with universal links learn more how users get redirected their regional app store onelink redirects users the correct regional app store based their address why isn onelink url redirecting users the specified domain check whether you have activated redirect allowlists appsflyer you have activated the desired web url domain subdomain must listed learn more about redirect allowlists onelink parameter faq what parameters are mandatory for onelink custom links only the media source pid parameter mandatory can parameters appended the short url yes any parameter can appended the short url important parameters appended the short url not override the parameters inside the link example you create onelink custom link with the following output long url https onelink sim onelink pid training peaches short url https onelink sim onelink you append the following parameters the short url https onelink sim onelink bananas adset fruits the adset fruits parameter appended the short url effective for attribution however the bananas parameter not effective since there already parameter the long url what custom media source names can use for owned media custom media source names can anything however recommended not use organic custom media source name this could affect attribution data integrity you using onelink for paid media use the integrated partner reserved pid values those ending with int media source values onelink custom links don use srn media sources like facebook facebook ads googleadwords twitter custom media source names this could affect attribution data integrity make sure the partner integrated appsflyer with activate partner toggle turned for all apps that are set the onelink template best practice not use organic custom media source name this could affect attribution data integrity what attribution parameters can added onelink you can add numerous attribution parameters enable you perform thorough drill down analysis attribution parameter description parameter link name campaign set campaign names compare different campaigns within the owned media source adset set set names compare different sets within specific campaigns the owned media source adset name set names compare different creatives within specific sets campaigns the owned media source channel set channel names you want compare more than one distribution channel for your owned media example you split sms messages between two sms service providers specify the provider using the channel parameter later you can compare the conversion rates the two providers channel subscriber parameters use any the available subscriber parameters insert values that are useful for your analysis note these parameters are parsed and appear raw data reports which makes them useful for performing data aggregation filtering sub sub sub sub sub custom parameters similar subscriber parameters you can specify fields with any parameter names and values and any names unlike subscriber parameters custom parameters are not parsed raw data they appear raw data reports only the original url column custom you specify see more information about appsflyer attribution link structure and parameters are custom parameters added onelink custom links available raw data yes custom parameters are passed the original url column raw data and can seen there they not have their own columns raw data for parsed data use subscriber parameters sub each which has separate column raw data reports are parameter names case sensitive yes make sure you use only lowercase letters for your parameters and values uppercase letters inconsistent capitalization parameter names and values could cause errors data discrepancies both the dashboard and raw data integrated partner faq can use onelink social apps unpaid you may want use onelink unpaid posts social apps since potential users who are exposed such posts cannot targeted advance according their devices unfortunately ios universal link limitations and restrictions set some social apps complicate the use onelink for basic device recognition redirection and attribution and deep linking certain cases may necessary set social app landing page uri scheme order redirect deep link users the following table summarizes when onelinks can used today popular social apps social app android users without app installed android deep linking ios users without app installed ios deep linking facebook including boosted posts facebook messenger snapchat instagram linkedin reddit slack twitter wechat whatsapp uri scheme social app landing page set note for facebook and facebook messenger both uri scheme and social app landing page are set the social app landing page doesn display must have uri scheme user may prompted open the link external browser can use onelink with networks paid yes but note that onelink mainly used with owned media not with networks this because networks usually advertise apps which means they know the user platform device and app and platform specific attribution links suffice using onelink isn necessary however for cases which networks don know the user platform advance for example when they run email sms campaigns themselves onelink can the solution important when you use onelink with networks you must use the onelink long url set onelink for partner networks follow the network attribution link instructions and select use onelink when prompted once all the parameters for android and ios are added correctly when the onelink custom link clicked and the user redirected the right platform the required parameters are sent the network within postback after the user installs example https greatapp onelink pid network int email idfa idfa gaid gaid clickid siteid sub pixel code sub creative the network uses either the idfa gaid parameters according the client device platform and disregards the other parameter how can solve the ios app launching issue from social media apps facebook and other social media apps sometimes block ios universal links from opening apps social app landing pages are the recommended solution for these app launching issues you not want use social app landing pages you can use uri schemes fallback method note however using uri schemes fallback subject ios based limitations for many browsers including safari you must add the force deeplink true parameter the url use uri schemes fallback learn more can use onelink instagram yes but aware the following limitations due the way instagram renders the text page post links are not clickable when entered into post caption app opening and deep linking into android apps are supported without any special considerations however instagram doesn support app opening and deep linking into ios apps overcome this issue you can take one two approaches recommended configure social app landing page the clustered poster and showandtell templates work best addition the social landing page recommend setting uri scheme your onelink template use uri scheme and forced deep linking when using onelinks instagram sure keep the following considerations mind the following when using force deeplink true with onelink instagram app installed click has force deeplink true result yes click opens the app store click opens the app store yes yes click opens the app yes click opens the app store can use onelink for redirection wechat wechat overrides android and ios deep links and redirects users web page from the web page the user must click the options button and choose open the page browser result users encounter broken user experience increasing the chance for them drop off the conversion funnel overcome this onelink recognizes clicks wechat and loads dedicated landing page instructing the user click the options button and then click open browser this turn opens the redirect url defined the onelink template setup the user wechat language registered chinese onelink generates localized version the landing page why are android users with the app installed being redirected web url and not into the app when they click link facebook webview opening the app and deep linking from facebook usually possible however the following conditions apply facebook not able open the app for existing app users from the onelink url instead all users including those with the app are sent the url defined the onelink template the value either the android url custom android url parameter user has android mobile device link clicked the facebook app link leads html page that opens facebook webview either site social app landing page the html page contains link with both parameter with uri scheme and url redirection setting either the onelink template parameter one android url custom android url testing faq how can test the social app landing page the social app landing page gives users seamless app launching experience when using onelink social network apps you may concerned that adding step the funnel decreases conversion rates but the truth that without the landing page user journeys are generally broken resulting very low conversion rates you not fully convinced why not test test your custom link social media apps with and without the social app landing page test the social app landing page create onelink link called link use with social media apps don set the social app landing page for this link add the adset attribution parameter add the attribution parameter with the value test link outside social media apps and verify the link works and launches your app correctly duplicate link and call link change the attribution parameter value using create the social app landing page for link only publish different posts the same social media app using link and link don worry about the different number clicks each link produces the important kpi the final conversion rate each link check the test results after enough traffic created the appsflyer overview dashboard and scroll down the aggregated performance report table link and link have the same media source campaign and adset name drill down the specific adset compare the conversion rates and other kpis users that clicked either link link how can bypass the app selection dialog you see app selection dialog when testing your onelinks make sure sign your app even debug app the certificate you use sign the app the same certificate you use generate the sha fingerprint when configuring onelink for app links deep linking faq what deep linking methods should implemented your developers should implement the unified deep linking udl method for deep linking see our full instructions for deep linking ios universal links and android app links are app launching methods which don actually deep link users sending them specific content within the app the uri scheme method can launch the app and deep link users via the custom link parameter but should only configured for app launching its main usage fallback method for universal links and app links and for app launching users with android versions prior after the app launched using any these methods the appsflyer sdk supplies the deep link value specified the custom attribution link this value should delivered via the udl method implemented your developers can uri scheme parameter used for deep linking yes but not recommended ideally you should use the deep link value for deep linking and the uri scheme fallback method launch the app without deep linking via the parameter however you already have the uri scheme set deep link with additional parameters concatenated part the uri path for example greatapp param param there need change your existing configuration code the uri scheme will continue work the best practice for adding custom parameters via the custom link setup page ios faq does onelink deep linking work for ios there user experience impact ios users who are deep linked from campaigns networks and owned media using the udl method the legacy method may impede deep linking for attribution reporting

click the billiards one the existing apps the campaign runs well bowling with conversion rate you decide advertise golfing well when you check the dashboard you see that the conversion rate for golfing much higher than the rate for bowling which allows you determine that there greater affinity between golfing and the promoted app billiards based these insights you could optimize your campaign follows run full scale cross promotion campaign golfing start attribute impressions addition clicks since you initially set your campaign measure only clicks installs from users that see the without clicking and then install later are counted organic installs instead non organic this means you don yet have complete picture the campaign performance for each source app custom dashboard the promoted app dashboard great for getting picture which source apps are driving the best traffic but what about you want evaluate the performance single existing app being used promote multiple apps this where custom dashboard can exactly what you need custom dashboard allows you view information from several promoted apps one place including cross promotion traffic addition custom dashboard quick and easy way share data with account users example you are marketer for ecommerce apps ltd and you have highly successful app called shoes you are now launching new apps accessories jackets and coats and sport shoes you decide run cross promotion campaign the shoe app see which your new apps does the best job promoting you divide your user base into segments each time user launches the shoe app out possible ads displayed for accessories for jackets and coats and for sport shoes view metrics for all promoted apps one place you create custom dashboard the following image you can see that

your business from potential technical issue and allows you find the cause the anomaly you find that the signature working expected and the clicks are being correctly blocked disable the circuit breaker using the configure circuit breaker method you find that clicks are being incorrectly blocked make sure that you have valid secret key checking the click signing configuration using the get configuration method use the click signing report get more information about the blocked clicks and investigate the sources agency app ids and reasons for invalid clicks you find problem with specific app because non standard integration exclude this app from click signing validation using the exclude app api you find problem with your configuration continue running report only mode fix the click signing process your side check the results the click signing report and enable click signing validation when you see that clicks are being validated expected faq how can test click signing without impacting production there are two ways test click signing use the test api this method useful during the development phase test the signatures single clicks use report only mode report only mode verifies the signatures the production clicks and shows you what would blocked but doesn block invalid clicks therefore you can test that click signing works without impacting real traffic what the difference between api token and secret key api token used authorize and run the click signing api there only one per network the appsflyer api token must obtained from the admin secret key used generate the signature use the generate secret key method create secret keys the network responsible for generating new secret keys see the traits section for more information can apply click signing only certain campaigns click signing applied all clicks from network you can exclude certain apps from click signing but you can exclude only certain campaigns traits trait description click signature the signature must occur the network servers secret key networks can have maximum two secret keys active simultaneously each secret key has expiration clicks signed with expired secret keys are

provided value for field not valid value for this column data format the column incorrect for example the date instead yyyy correct the format and resubmit multiple currencies identified for the app please use single currency for each app the file encountered currencies number currencies only one currency can used for app use one currency the upload and resubmit the following columns the file header are not supported file headers file header does not match the scheme meaning the column name needs exactly the scheme remove the unsupported columns and resubmit missing required columns file header file headers file header missing mandatory column add the missing column and its values and resubmit the app contains future date date future dates are not allowed correct the date today date earlier and resubmit the file empty there data process the file empty populate data the file and resubmit the following two rows conflict due identical dimensions please provide single row spend per set dimensions conflicting rows there more than one row with the same key mandatory fields remove the duplicate rows and resubmit the file can contain data only from single advertiser account different advertisers encountered file advertiser names for partners upload cannot for more than one advertiser split the upload into one file per advertiser the app app doesn exist the account please verify the app app does not exist correct the app and resubmit geo country code was not found for app app use iso letter code geo does not exist correct the geo and resubmit currency code was not found for app app use iso letter code currency does not exist change the currency valid currency and resubmit there were validation errors for one more apps the file please review the file information for more details there more than one error the file download the file and review for errors there was internal error processing the file please try uploading again backend issue processing the file typically temporary issue wait hour and upload again ingested cost data does not display displays separate row symptom cost data does not display after successful ingestion the dashboard check see the campaign name displays more than once locate the row where the campaign blank the row with the blank campaign contains the cost symptom the ingested cost displays separate additional row without performance installs data the campaign the row blank cause when both campaign and campaign name exist attribution data the csv must contain both order for appsflyer correctly match the cost data and avoid separate line items using excel format date and spend fields csv files when using excel google sheets create csv file the date and spend columns need formatted correctly before you save the file csv file use the following procedures format the date and spend fields correctly after saving the csv file verify that the content formatted correctly note don use excel the verification rather use editor formatting date cells excel format date cells excel with the format yyyy select the cells formatted right click select format cells the format cells window opens select custom the type field enter yyyy click the date formatted formatting spend cells excel excel usually formats value cells with comma separate the thousands shown the figure this format not suitable for spend ingestion files you can correct this formatting the cells excel format the spend amounts without separator select the cells formatted right click select format cells the format cells window opens select number clear use separator optional set the number decimal places the default the maximum permitted click the cells are formatted correctly visual inspection the csv file without excel examine the content the csv file use editor view the file windows notepad notepad macos textedit the following contains screenshot the example csv file displayed editor editor view using editor examine the csv file pay special attention the following blank spaces ensure that there are leading trailing blank spaces before after the commas that separate the fields excel use the trim command remove blank spaces date ensure that the date field has the format yyyy spend ensure that there comma the spend field csv files generated excel don have commas delimiters excel creates csv file with semi colon other character delimiter but not comma this occurs when your computer regional settings are set language region that not english this issue particularly prevalent when german selected the regional settings the solution differs depending your computer operating system macos windows resolve this issue search for the latest guidance from microsoft other forums revolve use the following search terms operating

according your mapping into events processed just like decoded cvs set the sdk note decode mode isn supported for skan custom conversion value decode implementing custom decode requires uploading csv file containing your mapping the appsflyer platform decode mapping principles provide decode mapping for conversion values not mandatory map the entire range values for example you can map values and always mapped install you can set the mapping table uploaded appsflyer csv file you can upload updated mapping table needed upon receiving postback from ios the decoded into events illustrated the examples the install time derived using the postback arrival time events have the same time the install time best understand how prepare the schema review the mapping scenarios that follow custom app events names are allowed meaning you send new event names even they haven ever been sent the sdk you can map the app events network app events this also true for facebook integration subject the facebook specific rules detailed the next section decode mapping scenario rules consider conversion value range given conversion value maps one more app events specified you app events have optional parameters for the examples assume that the install date feb the table that follows example decode mapping table its structure similar that the csv file required following the table are the events generated result the decoding process install event always generated irrespective your mapping revenue measurement revenue usd given conversion value has revenue range bounded min revenue and max revenue aggregated reports and dashboards revenue calculated the average the range example min revenue and max revenue the calculated revenue raw data reports include the calculated revenue skad revenue min revenue and max revenue facebook specific rules you integrate with facebook adhere the following rules min and max revenue values for given conversion value must different meaning not equal values mustn overlap and must consecutive order illustrated for conversion value and the table that follows event counter facebook doesn consider this value best practice populate with value conversion value event name event value min revenue not inclusive max revenue inclusive scale event counter hours from install purchase abc purchase def event event event xyz event event event event

conversion value yes integer value the same conversion value can listed more than once see the examples for further explanation event name yes string app event does not have event that already exists appsflyer note app event names are case sensitive best practice event name for revenue skad revenue event value string string set the developer containing data decoded the advertiser their systems typically this the format json min revenue integer floating use the min revenue and max revenue set revenue range usd you don want associate revenue with conversion value set min revenue and max revenue blank the value set min revenue not inclusive meaning greater than similar the value set max value inclusive example min revenue and max revenue this means the range max revenue must greater than min revenue note you generate the file using excel before saving change the column format comma and not currency avoid excel embedding symbol the csv file max revenue you populate min revenue max revenue must have value greater than see min revenue for the explanation event revenue usd deprecated starting june use min revenue and max revenue scale leave empty reserved for future use leave empty event counter yes integer number times the event duplicated decoding typically represents the number times the user performed given action minimum value example the user performed given event times then events are generated considerations you send revenue the total usd amount reported multiplied the value event counter meaning event value usd and event counter the total revenue reported see the examples hours from install yes integer hours elapsed since the install minimum value maximum value days the value for all rows given conversion value must identical meaning different values for different conversion values permitted appsflyer uses this derive and set the install time follows install date postback timestamp max hours from install event times are set equal the install time note raw data max time post install equal hours from install and min time post install one hour before this time upload conversion value schema file before you begin prepare the conversion value

the user interface upload the file turn skan measurement click save changes note for the next hours data the dashboard ambiguous meaning due ios timer issues can sure the decode mapping matches the encode mapping used you ensure that you have mapped your app events those used partners that they can consume postbacks correctly troubleshooting the csv upload errors file upload error messages one more values the file don match the required format the file format was changed starting june verify that your file format matches the example this article using excel format the event revenue usd column when using excel google sheets create csv file the event revenue usd column must formatted correctly before saving the file csv file after saving the csv file verify that the content formatted correctly note don use excel the verification rather use editor formatting event revenue usd cells excel excel usually formats value cells with comma separate the thousands shown the figure this format not suitable for upload csv files you must also remove the symbol you can correct this formatting the cells excel format the spend amounts without comma symbol select the cells formatted right click select format cells the format cells window opens select number clear use separator optional set the number decimal places the default the maximum permitted click the cells are formatted correctly visual inspection the csv file without excel examine the content the csv file use editor view the file windows notepad notepad macos textedit the following contains screenshot the example csv file displayed editor editor view using editor examine the csv file pay special attention the following blank spaces ensure that there are leading trailing blank spaces before after the commas that separate the fields excel use the trim command remove blank spaces event revenue usd ensure that there neither comma nor symbol the event revenue usd column csv files generated excel don have commas delimiters excel creates csv file with semi colon other characters delimiter but not comma this occurs when your computer regional settings are set language region that not english this issue particularly prevalent when german selected the regional settings the solution differs depending your computer operating system macos windows resolve this issue search for the latest guidance from microsoft other forums revolve use the following search terms operating system macos windows excel change delimiter for csv files"

event was performed both mandatory multiple use permitted yes setting options select app event then setup ranges according your measurement goal follows conversion only configure one range with range engagement and conversion configure multiple ranges with your selected ranges ranges for engagement measure engagement you must create occurrence ranges when occurrence the selected engagement event reported skan associates with the appropriate range according the number event occurrences characteristics each range contains occurrence range consisting from value and value the lower value isn included the range and the upper value for example means greater than and including the range with the lowest value always starts but doesn include itself you can create many ranges you wish but keep mind that each range affects your conversion value capacity ranges must sequential without gaps between ranges measuring engagement using ranges when event occurrence reported skan associates the occurrence with the appropriate range occurrences recorded are derived from the average the range the value rounded the nearest integer for example rounded the number occurrences exceeds the maximum value the highest value range the occurrences are associated with the highest value range the number occurrences recorded the average value the highest value range range other words the actual number occurrences disregarded raw data both the actual number occurrences and ranges are available example the image the following occurrence ranges are depicted the occurrence ranges set are number occurrences are recorded using the ranges follows example number occurrences reported the sdk associated range number occurrences reported limitation given app event can associated once with this component revenue component measure revenue generated the user during the activity window mandatory multiple use permitted yes using the app event revenue source setting options revenue can recorded using single event you can associate revenue stream using selected app events the following revenue source options are supported overall revenue any revenue recorded skan using the skad revenue event skad revenue should mapped the component can included once app event revenue reported type allocated selected app event and recorded skan using the selected app event the event should mapped skad revenue shouldn mapped the component can used multiple times you report revenue postback networks verify that your app event postback mappings include the app revenue events set you ranges measure revenue you must create revenue ranges when revenue reported skan associates the reported revenue with the appropriate range characteristics each range contains revenue range consisting from value and value the lower value isn included the range however the upper value included for example means greater than and including the range with the lowest value always starts but doesn include itself you can create many ranges you wish but keep mind that each range affects your conversion value capacity ranges must sequential without gaps between them amounts are usd you run campaigns facebook you must have more ranges range values can have digits after the decimal point recording revenue using ranges when revenue reported skan associates the revenue with the appropriate range the revenue recorded equals the average value the range the revenue reported exceeds the average value the highest value range the revenue associated with the highest value range note the revenue recorded the average value this range other words the actual revenue amount disregarded raw data the revenue recorded and the associated range are available example the image the following revenue ranges are depicted revenue recorded using the ranges follows example revenue reported the sdk associated range revenue recorded funnel component measures the occurrence app events based list sequential events funnel user performing any event the funnel regarded having performed all the events preceding that event mandatory multiple use permitted setting options list sequential set events funnel since the

illustrated the preceding image example event performed events recorded priority measurement component use the priority measurement component part custom mode rank user action journeys the app based your business logic that high priority measurements override low priority ones this enables you choose what measure each step the conversion funnel each priority maximum can contain revenue app event both when user performs events the app appsflyer determines which priority fits the actions performed the users and sets the accordingly for ease understanding let compare using custom with and

which you want find match simple patterns are constructed with characters for which you want find direct match when the search for match requires something more than direct match you can include special characters the pattern examples regular expression description abc starts with abc xyz ends with xyz abc xyz starts with abc and ends with xyz abc xyz starts with abc and doesn end with xyz starts with digits example param specified parameter value begins with empty only why doesn the source condition display suggested value when search for there are two possible reasons make sure the relevant app are selected the app isn selected values don display search results results display only the value you are searching for appeared your traffic during the past days additionally there lag day between when the conversion occurs and when the source condition displays menu option the value does not appear search result you can type the value free text and press the enter key your keyboard why media source options only include facebook ads and twitter the media sources field options are affected your agency selection non transparent agency selected one the traffic sources media sources display except for facebook ads and twitter which even non transparent agencies need transparent about note your rule applies multiple apps any agency that transparent some the selected apps but non transparent others considered non transparent this means you can select specific media sources other than facebook ads twitter necessary have and both within specific conditions and between condition groups depends your use case sometimes either option achieves the same results other times both options are necessary for example usa you support installs only later but brazil you support from and

attribution links report events appsflyer srns communicate with appsflyer events such new installs and app events differently srns use apis communicate with attribution and measurement providers when third party attribution providers detect install they query the network using the advertising srn reports the details any relevant clicks impressions appsflyer uses its standard attribution logic sequence the relevant impression and click data appsflyer attribution based both last touch and multi touch methodologies install attribution potential app users see and interact with multiple ads before they install app general attribution providers offer advertisers last touch attribution this attributes install the last click made before the actual install when app first launched appsflyer checks that the app set receive traffic from srns the user has advertising both conditions are true appsflyer queries srns using the advertising appsflyer performs attribution after considering srn claims install attribution examples example monday network reports user click tuesday network reports video engagement wednesday network reports click playable and minutes later there install appsflyer attributes the install network and gives networks and credit for assisting with the install appsflyer gives advertisers assist data unattributed engagements that occur before install this lets advertisers customize their multi touch fractional attribution models see this short explanation note that the case apple search ads asa appsflyer gets the attribution information from within the sdk available appsflyer sends back asa only the time and date the app launch example network srn reports click few minutes before network network uses standard attribution integration appsflyer attributes the install network they had the last click attribution windows attribution windows include lookback and view through some srns charge advertisers for install based cost per impression cpm and cost per action cpa these are based clicks impressions that occur within day period appsflyer attributes install activity effective cost per install ecpi and effective cost per action ecpa based advertiser preferred attribution methodology and lookback windows advertisers may have pay for installs based srn attribution lookback windows and view through models advertisers expect the appsflyer third party universal attribution methodology optimize and allocate their spend why because appsflyer reports actual ecpi and ecpa based advertiser defined terms srns may benefit the short term they often define their own payment terms but advertisers correct this using third party attribution providers deep linking with srns for users open your app when the link clicked you just need set app links universal links uri scheme however perform deep deferred deep linking specific page activity your app srns use their own methods without involving appsflyer deep linking method how can you deep link your users and get the relevant data from srns direct deep linking direct deep linking with srns when user device performs deep linking done without calling the appsflyer deep linking method the example below existing users clicking are redirected the activity directly using facebook methods while new users get the same experience using appsflyer conversion data learn how facebook uses onelink for deep linking example jill the mobile marketer greatapp decides run deep linking campaign facebook targeted general audiences the campaign redirects any clicking users bonus activity jack the mobile developer adds this logic after getting the conversion data facebook originated true true get the value the group parameter the value contains the word bonus send the user the bonus activity deferred deep linking contrast deep linking deferred deep linking with srns possible using the appsflyer gcd api appsflyer receives the conversion data and makes available the app the first launch new users that install after clicking deep linking retargeting campaign srn can redirected within the app upon launch using the conversion data however with srns the regular appsflyer deep linking parameters are not present part the deep link data use this data within the app the developer needs employ further logic based available parameters such campaign set single names note for facebook deferred deep linking via gcd available for android apps using the google install referrer mechanism isn available for ios apps ios implications most srns support skadnetwork and have the necessary integration with appsflyer ios srn attribution starting ios when users give att consent both the advertiser and publisher apps dual consent srn installs which are recorded the skadnetwork dashboard are also shown the traditional dashboards note the traditional dashboard shows reduction installs attributed srns when considering srn performance use the skadnetwork dashboard overall expect decrease srn attributions installs with matching increase organic installs the skadnetwork dashboard updates with lag hours after installs installs brought apple search ads asa aren attributed the skadnetwork dashboard sending event postbacks srns srns receiving event postbacks rely including the device the postback this enables srns self attribute reported user actions many ios users are non consenting meaning they don allow access their device idfa this case you should expect decrease the number event postbacks sent srns discrepancies the number event postbacks between srns and appsflyer who log all events note appsflyer doesn send postbacks for installs app opens app events there idfa except for this scenario google ads click networks are not affected they use their own transaction ids and not device ids self attribute event postback information faq how does retargeting work with srns retargeting clicks from non srns are easily identifiable the existence the

settings page turn enable retargeting the integrated partners page select the srn and turn retargeting with each app launch appsflyer queries the srn about recent engagements the device with campaign ads for the app the srn responds back with engagement details appsflyer validates the engagement within the lookback window and beyond the minimum time between engagements validated engagements are recorded engagements and attributed the srn what srn mistargeting srn campaigns should target specific audience but this doesn always happen non users user acquisition campaigns and existing users retargeting campaigns one srn used run both user acquisition and retargeting campaigns this can lead user mistargeting result you pay for unintended traffic scenario srn the appsflyer platform enabled for user acquisition campaign after each app launch appsflyer queries the srn check the advertising user had recent engagement yes srn replies with the campaign name appsflyer determines was the first launch not and attributes accordingly first launch new install attributed the campaign second later launch retargeting event attributed the campaign conclusion wasteful get retargeting events from user acquisition campaign mistargeting problem appsflyer data analysts checked facebook user acquisition campaigns during given month retargeting was enabled campaigns least targeted users were existing app users campaigns least were existing app users conclusion srn user acquisition campaigns targeted users already existing user solving the mistargeting problem basic solution don include existing app users user acquisition campaign srn will only target potential new users maximizes new user acquisition results for the same budget periodically and manually update the campaign for example once month however time gaps mean that existing users may targeted user acquisition campaigns during the first month after they install app audiences appsflyer premium feature lets you

retargeting for facebook you can get more installs your user acquisition campaigns for free how read here you make facebook raw data available agencies are not allowed provide facebook raw data agencies this because agencies are regarded third parties terms facebook terms services don see facebook raw data the installation and app events reports default facebook does not allow the distribution user level data see facebook ads advanced attribution for more details any specific columns for facebook appsflyer performance reports yes the performance reports have static column structures any combination selected media sources which present information down the campaign level however when you download performance reports only for facebook ads appsflyer adds columns them which present information down the single level the added columns are adset name adset adgroup single name and adgroup can work with facebook fmps and measure performance with appsflyer yes appsflyer integrated with dozens facebook mobile partners these partners can set for attributing the integrated partners page the dashboard for details about setting attribution with fmps click here what should

the facebook developer portal and you can you can safely ignore this error message what happens with different lookback windows than facebook day click and day view are the maximum and default lookback windows for facebook configuring these windows shorter appsflyer decreases facebook attribution appsflyer the other hand configuring them longer appsflyer has effect installs taking part after facebook windows end not get attributed facebook therefore minimize discrepancies the recommendation configure the facebook lookback windows appsflyer day clicks and day views what are the facebook api parameters some appsflyer apis facebook parameters have different names than displayed the dashboard for backward compatibility reasons consult the table below conversion data appsflyer raw data facebook campaign campaign campaign group name campaign campaign campaign group adgroup adgroup name adgroup adgroup adset adset campaign name adset adset campaign agency partner media source channel channel publisher platform how long you keep facebook user level data facebook requires attribution providers delete its user level data months after the install this means that the events performed these users months after they install the app are counted organic past aggregate data remains the same this relevant for all facebook channels facebook app instagram messenger and audiencenetwork can use onelink with the facebook mobile app install objective facebook has various advertising objectives choose from when you run ads for app app installs traffic and conversions for most objectives like traffic conversions onelink links other third party links are accepted however for the app install objective facebook only accepts facebook app links for deep linking can onelink links used for app opening and deep linking facebook dynamic product ads yes onelink links with app links universal links uri schemes configured are supported dynamic product ads you can use onelink links your data feed for catalogs used dynamic ads under the applink ios url and applink android url fields facebook ads cost faq getting facebook cost data the appsflyer dashboard appsflyer gets spend data including clicks and impressions from facebook campaigns one more installs occurred during the previous days facebook campaign engages with multiple platforms android ios desktop etc the cost the dashboard platform specific and calculated facebook getting facebook cost including clicks and impressions facebook cost example advertiser runs campaigns using facebook ads appsflyer the advertiser sees the following the cost information provided facebook appsflyer the number installs calculated appsflyer using appsflyer attribution rules result the ecpi calculated facebook and appsflyer usually differs can see old facebook cost data the appsflyer dashboard upon performing the first facebook admin login described above appsflyer receives facebook cost data days retroactively for existing campaigns cost data from beforehand isn available subsequent syncs appsflyer also receives data from the last days this means that cost clicks and impressions data collected for all campaigns which have least conversion during the last days cost data was fine for few months but stopped displaying facebook may reset this permission get the cost data every few months you notice the cost data stopped appearing the dashboard please repeat the facebook admin login steps again the facebook admin user changes their facebook password the login steps must repeated well clicked facebook minutes ago why don see the click appsflyer appsflyer gets aggregated clicks impressions and cost data from facebook periodically every few hours therefore may take few hours before these actions are displayed appsflyer dashboard can get raw data clicks and impressions from facebook appsflyer gets only aggregated click and impression data from facebook the entire set raw clicks and impressions not available the only raw clicks and impressions available raw reports are those that resulted installs are there limitations facebook cost data geo you filter geo appsflyer dashboard you can see the summary and breakdown the facebook cost data this data available only for mobile app install campaigns facebook addition cost geo data only available for single platform campaigns this means campaigns that have android targeted set and ios targeted set can have geo specific cost data get the full cost data dedicate campaign each platform what are the limitations facebook cost data master api facebook doesn support grouping cost data geo and channel simultaneously master api reports create report with complete cost data group only one these dimensions the total cost doesn match there are differences between facebook and appsflyer attribution models these differences may lead discrepancies with facebook cost data facebook cross device attribution this might sometimes cause issues where campaign for one platform ios android shows install with its cost for another platform facebook non mobile campaigns these campaigns like facebook link click campaigns desktop users may eventually install mobile apps for these cross device campaigns appsflyer does not show cost however the link click was performed the same device that installed the app cost data received for example facebook user clicks leading the advertiser landing page desktop computer week later the same facebook user installs the advertiser ios app iphone device while the install attributed and displayed appsflyer dashboard the cost this cross platform install not campaigns with results the last days appsflyer syncs the cost only for campaigns that had installs conversions the past days facebook cost was just set campaigns which were inactive for more than days beforehand will not show cost why the appsflyer calculation for ecpi different from the cost calculated facebook while the total cost identical the cost per install calculated dividing the total cost with the number installs since appsflyer counts installs differently from facebook the ecpi will usually differ between the two why doesn cost data include data from all campaigns when user performing the facebook login described above doesn have access facebook some the running campaigns the result campaigns that are displayed appsflyer dashboard but lack some the cost clicks and impression data note although several facebook users may have permission run campaigns the facebook business manager only one required perform the facebook login facebook cost data displayed for retargeting campaigns cost and roi data for retargeting campaigns can found the unified view cohort reports why does the facebook cost configuration window close before login you signed facebook the same browser that you are performing the configuration the window automatically connects facebook using those credentials and access has already been granted appsflyer app then there nothing and the window closes why there discrepancy cost data for apps the amazon app store contrary appsflyer data facebook doesn distinguish between cost data from android apps opposed amazon apps which are android based therefore the cost data amazon users may attributed campaigns targeting other android users instead the original amazon campaigns how connect cost data new facebook account while old account linked you want switch new facebook account but your facebook cost already linked via appsflyer with your old account you need disconnect the account via facebook and connect the new account appsflyer facebook settings business integration the active tab remove the appsflyer integration appsflyer dashboard and connect the cost with the new account facebook ads sdk faq who needs facebook sdk your app may already have the facebook sdk integrated into before the appsflyer sdk even not you may wonder whether you really need facebook sdk addition appsflyer sdk and you can the two exist without duplicate reporting your app does not require the facebook sdk for the following user acquisition generally the appsflyer sdk takes care all mobile user acquisition attribution purposes your facebook users including engagements installs sessions and post install events deep linking open the app when the link clicked and deep link users specific page activity the app you can use onelink without the facebook sdk however you need uri scheme configured open the app universal links and android app links not work facebook scrapes the onelink url and uses create facebook app link that opens the app and deep links the user your app requires the facebook sdk addition the appsflyer sdk for the following deferred deep linking currently only possible access facebook ddl data via the conversion data legacy method for both ios and android apps the facebook sdk required make this data available the conversion data method however android and google play only possible perform deferred deep linking using the google install referrer mechanism dynamic product ads campaigns data you can only get data for dynamic product ads from the facebook sdk other facebook features you may need facebook sdk for reasons unrelated attribution such authentication monetization social sharing user invites etc note the above information and recommendations regarding deep linking and deferred deep linking are based thorough testing conducted using facebook available demo preview tools which uses different mechanism than live ads avoiding duplicates with facebook sdk you have both sdks your app install and app events are reported facebook sdk and then via postbacks facebook servers through appsflyer how can you avoid this duplicate reporting installs facebook duplicates app installs both facebook sdk and appsflyer report new user installing mobile app facebook knows count this install only once cases when facebook ads sdk initialized the app launch before the appsflyer sdk the install recorded only facebook ads and not appsflyer verify that the appsflyer sdk initialized app launch before the facebook ads sdk app events facebook does not duplicate app events which are reported from both its sdk methods well from another source appsflyer this means that unless taken care facebook may report double revenue and other events falsely use either these possible methods avoid duplicate app event reporting facebook don configure events the facebook sdk for android disable the facebook app events mapping from appsflyer note that enable skan attribution for ios you need map app events facebook ads facebook ads attribution faq attributing agencies with facebook agencies and fmps can run and attribute facebook campaigns behalf advertisers appsflyer even alongside the advertisers own facebook campaigns order for the agency campaigns attributed the agency the campaign name must begin with the agency name note that for ios users only one agency can run campaigns for specific account see more about facebook ads and appsflyer skadnetwork interoperability for more details about agencies and facebook install attribution please here addition agencies can alter facebook lookback windows and retargeting control rather they need ask the advertiser perform these changes they needed besides agencies cannot modify any app event postbacks sent facebook the reason for that facebook requirement receive information about all installs including those that are not attributed and therefore may not brought the agency the image below shows all settings that need configured the advertiser for the agency able manage its facebook campaigns attribution for facebook for out store android apps facebook doesn allow creating mobile apps install campaigns for android apps that are out store markets for example baidu however you can advertise and record installs for out store apps facebook following these instructions the developer has prepare separate apk for each out store market you use advertise your app more details here create traffic conversions campaign facebook with mobile attribution enabled which sends leads landing page the landing page should include download app button which directly links the out store market where the apk exists the lead clicks the button and redirected the out store market after completing the installation appsflyer attributes the user facebook via its mmp api note the same solution applies apps google play and the app store which require landing page prior the redirection the market for specific instructions attribution for apps amazon facebook click here what facebook android and ios cross attribution facebook identifies users based their facebook account some users have both ios and android devices associated with the same facebook account such user clicks views for your app their android device but install the app their ios device facebook considers themselves having generated the install result android campaign name appears your ios dashboard example andrew josef busy his android device while using clicks android facebook campaign for app called bubbles does not download the app one day later andrew josef decides download the bubbles app organically his ios device and launches this situation appsflyer attribution takes the android facebook campaign from facebook and presents the ios dashboard where andrew josef downloaded and launched from what are facebook ads channels with facebook you can see data broken down not only campaigns sets and ads but also facebook channels called placements facebook facebook channel users from the facebook app instagram users from the instagram app messenger users from the facebook messenger app

postbacks apps using appsflyer their attribution partner how does the limit skan campaign ids impact the limit relates the way you sign and number your campaigns apple means that any time you can have simultaneous unique campaigns allow you enrich the postback with your actual campaign name and meaning you map the skan campaign your actual campaign ids use the time the postback received doing means that the limit does not restrict the number campaigns that you measure appsflyer provided course that you don have more than simultaneous campaigns for given app"

the capabilities the predict dashboard and how you can use these capabilities efficiently analyze your data and take meaningful action example let say you are manager responsible for running campaigns the and you want look the predicted quality users being driven the campaigns you started last week the main kpi you use evaluate campaign performance roas using the filter bar you set the date range display the data for installs during the past days and you set the geo filter display only data for the addition your new campaigns you have many ongoing campaigns for the moment you want focus only the campaigns you started running last week you use the campaign filter select only these campaigns you change the data visualization options show the proas kpi for now you keep the other options set the default values dimension media source characteristics campaign and media source this means each row represents media source and each bubble the row represents cohort users attributed the same media source and campaign even with the filters you applied there are lots small bubbles that make harder analyze your data you change the minimum cohort size this allows you focus only the largest cohorts you notice that there are several bubbles the left side the distribution meaning that they have low proas comparison other cohorts you decide that you want concentrate now only those cohorts with proas less than you slide the right endpoint the value filter down you want understand there are specific site ids that are pulling down the proas you change the characteristics selected the data visualization options you remove the campaign characteristic and add site instead after this change each row still represents media source but now each bubble represents cohort users attributed the same media source and site with the revised view you quickly see that just few site ids that have low proas when you click these bubbles the kpis the bubble details panel show that these cohorts

started during any given cycle the team currently evaluating requests participate the predict beta get touch with your appsflyer csm sales representative you like included once your apps are accepted part the beta these are the steps for getting board define additional app events identify and describe revenue events determine retention measurement dates let the machine learning begin define additional app events the higher the number app events defined per app and the better these events reflect that app ltv logic the more reliable the predicted kpis will there limit the number events you can measure fact quite the opposite the more the better what types app events should defined these are the factors considered when defining app events timing particular importance are events that take place within the first hours newly acquired user activity but don stop there for maximum accuracy and ongoing fine tuning each app unique prediction logic predict needs many app event measurements possible throughout the entire user journey quality the quality event determined how closely reflects the user journey and ltv calculation for each individual app the first step create

according your business needs once complete share the file with your developer important get new app events set for reporting appsflyer quickly possible since predict requires weeks history order utilize them part its predictions new app events need added the sdk you can report app events appsflyer either via the appsflyer sdk through server server integration even you are currently reporting installs and app events appsflyer via the sdk you can set additional app events reported via this may useful option you wish avoid updating the sdk and releasing new version your app identify and describe revenue events order effectively predict revenue the predict engine must able identify which app events are related revenue will work with you completing this process the predict team will create spreadsheet every app event defined for your app will ask you identify which are revenue events and define the type revenue they relate for example banner interstitial view rewarded video etc determine retention measurement dates addition prevenue and other revenue based predictions predict able predict the percentage newly acquired users who will still using your app number days post install during the onboarding process you will able specify dates number days post install for which you want predict retention available retention measurement dates days and note predicted retention measurement limited dates result skadnetwork bit conversion value limitation let the machine learning begin order provide accurate ltv predictions for your campaigns the predict engine must review the app historical data using the definitions and factors defined the previous steps the app owner and appsflyer the main goal this training process identify correlations between early user engagement signals and ltv day takes approximately days for this intensive initial machine learning process completed which point you will begin see data the predict dashboard after onboarding once the onboarding process complete you can map predicted kpis app event postbacks for relevant partners the integrated partners page the appsflyer dashboard these kpis are then shared events with partners who can use this information start optimizing your campaigns you can decide map all kpis some none all based your advertising strategy and business goals mapping not required enable predict logic predictions the events each partner makes available for mapping varies and some partners support mapping custom defined events make sure your partners optimization logic supports the events you are mapping the way you intend them example let say you have different apps app and app and you want optimize your campaigns differently for each app the decision which kpis map depends the types users you want focus for app you want target your campaigns users most likely spend money the app for this app you could map the sdk event predict revenue the partner mobile purchase event this allows your partner optimize your campaigns towards those users most likely high paying users for app you are more interested users who will continue use your app over the long term for this app you could map the sdk event predict retention users predicted using your app days post install the partner session event this allows your partner optimize your campaigns target those users most likely stay with the app map predicted kpis events from the appsflyer overview dashboard configuration integrated partners select the relevant integrated partner the integration tab under app event postbacks map your selected sdk events those starting with predict the selected partner event identifiers notes you should only map sdk retention events for the retention measurement dates you have selected for example predict

resources are able obtain preliminary indications user ltv only after days this time lag makes the first days user acquisition campaign period high uncertainty managers are generally encouraged leave

ltv predictions and connecting them with cost data predict determines predicted campaign and cohort level kpis allowing you the timely opportunity invest more the campaigns and cohorts that are yielding good users stop running campaigns targeting cohorts that are not yielding good users adjust campaign and cohort targeting for those performing somewhere between make bid adjustments for campaigns and cohorts whose costs are disproportionate the quality users they yield how does work predict algorithms are based the analysis app event data recorded appsflyer through sdk integration the more closely you can reflect user journey through the measurement app events the more accurate predictions will particular significance user activity within the first hours post install for this reason you are encouraged set many app events possible measure activity throughout the entire user journey with specific emphasis the first hours post install for detailed information about app event setup see getting started with predict order train its engine for each individual app predict analyzes the app historical data searching for correlations between early signals user behavior and user ltv day the analysis far more comprehensive than simply accounting for the occurrence event but also takes into account all the factors surrounding the event and their potential contribution ltv many these correlations are non intuitive and could predicted only this type advanced data science example let say user makes purchase your app considering the relationship this purchase pltv predict considers much more within your app historical data than just the occurrence purchase also analyzes numerous additional factors such how much time elapsed between install and purchase how many app

predicts user level kpis revenue based predictions day retention based predictions dates you selected during the onboarding process available retention measurement dates days and aggregates campaign and cohort level kpis based user level kpis connects actual acquisition cost ecpi predict campaign and cohort level roas reports kpis the predict dashboard and predict reports predicting user level kpis inputs the following are examples inputs that predict might consider when predicting user level kpis app purchases subscriptions views and similar events number frequency and length sessions game levels achieved tutorials completed recommendations friends etc note that these are just examples actual inputs will vary based the app events you set measured appsflyer outputs predict uses these inputs order predict user level kpis outputs the following categories monetization predicted revenue generated the user day including prediction whether user will generate revenue day all retention prediction whether the user will still using the app the retention measurement dates you selected during the onboarding process note within the context predict retention has somewhat different meaning than does for the appsflyer retention dashboard for predict retained user day not necessarily predicted open the app day itself retained user day predicted open the app either day and least one time after day within the day prediction period example charlie installs the app and predicted open only day lucy installs the app and predicted open only day user retained day retained day charlie yes lucy yes yes analysis even though lucy isn predicted open the app day she still considered retained user day because she predicted open the app afterwards day aggregating campaign and cohort level kpis calculate campaign and cohort level kpis predict aggregates predicted user level kpis divides the number acquired users installs per campaign cohort measured attribution data connecting cost finally predict connects aggregate user acquisition cost based data received from networks meaning not predicted value once predict receives cost data are able provide further insights such predicted roas learn more about cost aggregation using xpend reporting kpis user level predictions are aggregated and combined with the number users acquired installs and user acquisition cost provide the following campaign and cohort level kpis underlying metrics users total number new user installs the campaign cohort actual value measured attribution data prevenue predicted total revenue for the

the appsflyer sdk within the first hours develop anonymous user level predictions such predicted revenue day all these events are recorded without attribution data ensuring compliance with the att framework and maintenance user privacy because the bit limitation predict assigns each user revenue buckets once their ltv predicted the value the first bucket and for users that aren predicted generate revenue each the remaining buckets represents range revenue values customized your business logic and determined during the onboarding process assigns each user retention buckets the value the first bucket and for users who aren predicted keep using the app the day ranges for each the remaining buckets are determined the retention measurement dates you selected during the onboarding process all these predictions are transmitted skan single conversion value utilizing all permitted bits fewer skan waits hours then reports this value the network along with campaign and attribution source finally the network reports the conversion value along with attribution data back appsflyer where decoded connected cost and reported the predict dashboard lot communicate just bits bits translates maximum values order comply with skan bit conversion value limitation predict applies sophisticated machine learning algorithm encode predicted user level kpis and transmit them skan single

several challenges that app owners face google play services gps not active the majority android devices meaning has gaid the use third party android app stores creates opportunities for store hijacking device manufacturers attribution servers are inaccessible slow respond managing and viewing attribution data from google play and third party android app stores using appsflyer these challenges can overcome implementing attribution based oaid using device imei alternative gaid devices having android version earlier preparing apks with unique identifiers detect android store hijacking configuring attribution links that are recognized within china preparing the app integrate the sdk the app and prepare the apk using one the methods according the target devices android

sdk sdk will attempt collect oaid automatically default multiple manufacturers have completed oaid attribution interop testing with appsflyer including huawei lenovo opro vivo samsung and xiaomi imei appsflyer sdk prevents access imei unless configured otherwise the general assumption that google play services active the device and that imei not needed china this not the case when integrating the

the third party app stores and google play store display single entity this option requires that the package name both the google play store and the third party stores identical using this option assume that the app already defined appsflyer use this method continue preparing the apk manifest the section that follows multiple apps means that the attribution data each store shown under separate

explained the section that follows best practice set this field market app url note you can create the app using the pending approval unpublished option but this not recommended consult with your csm before using this method preparing the apk manifest prepare separate apk manifest for each third party app store follows add the following the manifest identify chinese traffic meta data android name channel android value market note parameters are case sensitive recommend that you set the channel market choose one the following methods identify the store manifest method add the following line the

store field attribution data this field available cohort analysis raw data reports additional attribution considerations workaround for stores without attribution link support many third party android app stores china also sell traffic meaning they are also platform some cases these stores not support the use attribution links the following workaround solutions can used alternative install app store field recommended when installation takes place without attribution link appsflyer attributes the installation organic installs using the install app store field you can identify the actual source the install note the install app store field set using the store parameter described the previous section preinstall name the manifest file using the preinstall name contained the manifest the disadvantage this method that where the preinstall apk leaked the market attribution information will incorrect when using this method ensure that you have the appropriate commercial terms protect your apk china domestic attribution links when preparing attribution links take into account the following china based links for media sources that only have domestic chinese traffic use the domain links detailed here these links are recognized from within china and provide superior user experience for regular attribution links use https app aflink com aflink com for onelink attribution links use https onelnk com onelnk com note before using the onelnk com domain contact your appsflyer csm note that wechat only onelnk com allowlisted whereas onelink blocked use use make sure users are redirected either apk download url apk store and not google play store note frequently china domestic integrated media sources have this parameter set redirect false the default attribution url template meaning that redirection will done the platforms and not appsflyer for more information about integrated media sources android app promotion china detecting store hijacking third party app store scenarios users first install the app from the media source networks third party store the case installation hijack warning pop suggests the user installs updates the app directly from the device phone manufacturer app store where the user agrees the user directed download from the manufacturer app store and the apk downloaded meaning that the device manufacturer has hijacked the install the following example illustrates both legitimate flow and hijacked flow legitimate flow app user clicks displayed media example and either immediately downloads the app redirected the legitimate app store download the app appsflyer the following attribution information recorded media source media example install app store legitimate app store hijacked flow app user clicks displayed media example when the download initiated warning pop appears suggesting that the user downloads the app from the device manufacturer app store the user agrees they are redirected the manufacturer store and download the app appsflyer the following attribution information recorded media source media example install app store manufacturer store identifying the hijack event appsflyer identify the hijacked install you compare the media source and install app store fields mismatch between the expected install app store and the actual install app store indicates installation hijack"
