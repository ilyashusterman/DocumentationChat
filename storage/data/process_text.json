      "At a glance: A user who views an ad (impression) and subsequently installs the app, is attributed by view-through attribution. View-through attribution measures installs, re-attributions, and re-engagements of users who viewed an ad but didn't click on it. View-through attribution flow Terminology Impression: The display of an ad to a user regardless of any click or other user engagement. Install: In this article, means installs, re-attributions, and re-engagements. View-through attribution: Attributing installs to a media source after the user sees an impression. View-through attribution principles Both device ID matching and probabilistic modeling (which you must turn on) are supported. Supported by partners listed in the Integrated Partners view-through attribution partner list. Impressions are candidates for view-through attribution using the following principles: The impression occurred within the view-through lookback window (default 24 hours). If multiple impressions are found, the most recent impression is considered. Clicks have priority over impressions. This means that if there are clicks in the click-through lookback window, the most recent click wins. The most recent impression is attributed as a contributor (assist). View-through lookback window For non-SRNs, the view-through attribution lookback window duration is 1-24 hours. For SRNs, the lookback window can be longer. To set the window: Non-SRNs: Set the duration using impression attribution links by setting the af_viewthrough_lookback parameter. If the parameter isn't set, a default 24 hours window is used. SRNs: The window is determined by the SRN. We recommend setting the same value as the SRN's in AppsFlyer.",
      "View-through attribution reporting and metrics Aggregate data: Ad networks report aggregate impression data to AppsFlyer via API, or on a per-impression basis. Consider that impression counting and reporting is defined by each partner individually. See definitions of impressions and clicks by major integrated partners.The related metrics are available in the Overview dashboard and via other reporting tools. The metrics available are: Impressions: Number of impressions displayed during a given period. View-throughs: The number of installs attributed using view-through attribution.",
      "Raw-data: User-level data (raw data) of users attributed via view-through attribution is available and similar to that of users attributed by click. However, some partners restrict the availability of this data. Impression data (similar to click data) is available. The attributed_touch_type field contains the value impression.",
      " View-through operations Set impression links Ad networks send impression links to AppsFlyer populated with campaign and other details similar to those included in click-through attribution links. The links are sent in real-time so that if an install follows an impression, it is attributed correctly. Consider the following in preparing links: The base URL is http://impression.appsflyer.com. Both HTTP and HTTPS protocols are supported. Use a GET request. Include device IDs where available: IDFA, GAID, IDFV, and so on. Include probabilistic modeling parameters. The device ID values can be hashed for better security using SHA1. The parameter name should begin with \"sha1_\" and be followed by the parameter name and the hashed value, for example, sha1_idfa, sha1_advertising_id, sha1_android_id, and sha1_imei. Example http://impression.appsflyer.com/{app-id}?c={campaign name}&pid={media source} &af_viewthrough_lookback=1d&af_prt={agency_name}&af_siteid={site id value} &af_sub1={free value}&idfa={idfa value}",
      " Set custom impression links Advertisers utilize attribution impression links with their own custom media sources, for example, website banners. When advertisers create custom attribution links, they get full impression links, which can be fired every time a user engages with their owned ads. Custom impression links (created via OneLink) can also be used to perform view-through attribution of mobile website visitors.Learn more about creating custom impression URLs.",
      "Turn off view-through-attribution By default, view-through attribution is turned on. If AppsFlyer receives a valid impression attribution link, the impression participates in the attribution flow. Since view-through attribution is enabled by default, it's important that advertisers contractually agree with the network in advance whether or not their view-through attribution should be enabled. View-through attribution can be disabled per media source. However, if impressions are received, and view-through attribution is disabled: Impression metrics are available in the dashboard. The attribution process ignores these impressions. To turn off view-through-attribution: In AppsFlyer, go to Integration > Integrated Partners. Select the integrated partner. In the Integration tab, turn off Install view-through attribution. Click Save integration.

    "title": "Using AppsFlyer with TWA",
    "answers": [
      "At a glance: Use AppsFlyer with Trusted Web Activities (TWA) to measure installs and record in-app events. Introduction What are Trusted Web Activities? Trusted web activities (TWA) are a new way to integrate web content with your Android app. The challenge with TWA is to be able to record in-app events. This challenge is addressed in this article. For more information about TWA, see here. TWA can also be used with Progressive Web Apps. What are Progressive Web Apps? Progressive Web Apps (PWA) are apps that deliver app-like experience but are actually completely web-based. One form of PWA is an Android app whose activities are TWA-based. This is the form of PWA that is discussed in this article. TWA enables you to embed your PWA inside a standalone android application, effectively allowing you to feature your existing PWA application on Play Store. The other form, one that is purely web-based, is not discussed in this article. For more information about PWA, see here. This tab discusses PWA thatis embedded in a Trusted Web Activity, an in app full screen web browser. Such apps have the Android global application class but whose activities are solely web-based. This form of PWA allows you to measure installs. The other form of PWA, those that are purely web-based, doesn't give you the option to measure installs. TWA Sending in-app events from TWA In-app events are sent using the AppsFlyer SDK from native app activities. Since TWA is web-based and not a native activity, you cannot send in-app events using the AppsFlyer SDK. You can use server-to-server in-app eventsas an alternative. Follow the instructions below to send server-to-server events with TWA. Prerequisites Before you can start sending events from TWA to AppsFlyer, do the following: Add the following repository to the project level gradle file: maven { url \"https://jitpack.io\"} Add the following libraries: For android.support libraries: Add the following in your build.gradle:implementation 'com.github.GoogleChrome.custom-tabs-client:customtabs:91b4a1270b' Import the following libraries: import android.support.customtabs.CustomTabsClient; import android.support.customtabs.CustomTabsIntent; import android.support.customtabs.CustomTabsServiceConnection; import android.support.customtabs.CustomTabsSession; import android.support.customtabs.trusted.TrustedWebActivityIntentBuilder; import static android.support.customtabs.TrustedWebUtils.EXTRA_LAUNCH_AS_TRUSTED_WEB_ACTIVITY",
      "For androidX libraries: Add the following in your build.gradle: implementation 'com.github.GoogleChrome:android-browser-helper:ff8dfc4ed3' Import the following libraries: import androidx.browser.customtabs.CustomTabsClient; import androidx.browser.customtabs.CustomTabsIntent; import androidx.browser.customtabs.CustomTabsServiceConnection; import androidx.browser.customtabs.CustomTabsSession; import androidx.browser.trusted.TrustedWebActivityIntentBuilder;",
      "Getting the AppsFlyer ID To send server-to-server events, you need the AppsFlyer ID. You can get the AppsFlyer ID from AppsFlyer Android SDK. First, make sure to integrate the AppsFlyer Android SDK. You can then get the AppsFlyer ID using the following SDK API: String appsflyerId = AppsFlyerLib.getInstance().getAppsFlyerUID(this); Sending the AppsFlyer ID to TWA You can send the AppsFlyer ID in one of two ways: Append AppsFlyer ID and customer user ID to URL When you build a trusted web activity intent, you can pass parameters to its URL: private void launchTwa(String cuid, String af_id) { CustomTabsServiceConnection customTabsServiceonnection = new CustomTabsServiceConnection() { @Override public void onCustomTabsServiceConnected(ComponentName name, CustomTabsClient client) { Log.d(LOG_TAG, \"onCustomTabsServiceConnected\"); // Setting up CustomTabsSession that is used to build an intent mClient = client; CustomTabsSession session = mClient.newSession(null); // Creating the intent to launch TWA using URL with query params that can be read by the Web App TrustedWebActivityIntentBuilder twaIntentBuilder = new TrustedWebActivityIntentBuilder(Uri.parse(defaultUri + \"?cuid=\" + cuid + \"&appsflyer_id=\" + af_id)); Intent twaIntent = twaIntentBuilder.build(session); startActivity(twaIntent); } @Override public void onServiceDisconnected(ComponentName name) { Log.d(LOG_TAG, \"onCustomTabsServiceDisconnected\"); } }; CustomTabsClient.bindCustomTabsService(getApplicationContext(), \"com.android.chrome\", customTabsServiceonnection); } Retrieving the AppsFlyer ID Once the web activity is launched you can retrieve the AppsFlyer ID using a simple JavaScript snippet: let url = new URL(document.location.href); let appsflyerID; url.searchParams.forEach((value, key) => { if(key === 'appsflyer_id') { \tappsflyerID = value; } }) Once you have the AppsFlyer ID, store in local storage for later use.",
      "Sending AppsFlyer ID through custom headers You can pass custom headers to the trusted web activities. The server gets these headers, sets them in a cookies and sends to the browser. You can then retrieve the AppsFlyer ID using javascript: private void launchTwa(String cuid, String af_id) { CustomTabsServiceConnection customTabsServiceonnection = new CustomTabsServiceConnection() { @Override public void onCustomTabsServiceConnected(ComponentName name, CustomTabsClient client) { Log.d(LOG_TAG, \"onCustomTabsServiceConnected\"); // Setting up CustomTabsSession that is used to build an intent mClient = client; CustomTabsSession session = mClient.newSession(null); // Creating the intent to launch TWA using URL with query params that can be read by the Web App TrustedWebActivityIntentBuilder twaIntentBuilder = new TrustedWebActivityIntentBuilder(Uri.parse(defaultUri); Intent twaIntent = twaIntentBuilder.build(session); // Passing additional custom headers to the intent so they can be read by the Web App Bundle customHeaders = new Bundle(); customHeaders.putString(\"twa_params\", \"cuid=\" + cuid + \"&=appsflyer_id\" + af_id\"); twaIntent.putExtra(Browser.EXTRA_HEADERS, customHeaders); startActivity(twaIntent); } @Override public void onServiceDisconnected(ComponentName name) { Log.d(LOG_TAG, \"onCustomTabsServiceDisconnected\"); } }; CustomTabsClient.bindCustomTabsService(getApplicationContext(), \"com.android.chrome\", customTabsServiceonnection); } Retrieving the AppsFlyer ID JavaScript doesn\u2019t provide an API to allow developers to access headers. Therefore, the server should send the conversion data back to the web activity as a cookie. The server gets the custom headers containing the AppsFlyer ID, parses the data and sends it to the web page as a cookie. When the page loads, a JavaScript snippet should be set in place to fetch the AppsFlyer ID cookie. // get the conversion data cookie // function taken from https://plainjs.com/javascript/utilities/set-cookie-get-cookie-and-delete-cookie-5/ function getCookie(name) { var v = document.cookie.match('(^|;) ?' + name + '=([^;]*)(;|$)'); return v ? v[2] : null; } // get the cookie var conversionData = JSON.parse(getCookie('appsflyer_id')); console.log(appsflyer_id);",
      " Sending the in-app event To send in-app events, you need to send the event data to your server and have your server send the event to AppsFlyer. There are a few other prerequisites for sending in-app events: SDK dev key - Important! The SDK dev key is a sensitive value and shouldn't be present in the TWA. If you are going to use TWA and send server-to-server in-app events, always store the SDK dev key securely server-side. App ID - the app ID as it appears in Android Manifest.xml. Once you have these three parameters (AppsFlyer ID, SDK dev key, app ID), you can send the in-app event. Whenever an event takes place on the web activity you should send a request to your webserver to handle this event. The webserver gets the data related to the event, composes the event, and sends it to AppsFlyer. See here for examples how to send server-to-server in-app events.",
      "Customizing web content with conversion data The AppsFlyer SDK provides you with conversion data through two APIs: Get conversion data - called when the app is launched for the first time after an install and for subsequent app launches. On app open attribution - called when the app is deep-linked into using OneLink. You can use conversion data to customize web content. Sending conversion data to TWA Once you get the conversion data from either method listed above, you can send it to your web server. To do so, use custom headers: private void launchTwa(Map<String, String> conversionData, String cuid, String af_id) { CustomTabsServiceConnection customTabsServiceonnection = new CustomTabsServiceConnection() { @Override public void onCustomTabsServiceConnected(ComponentName name, CustomTabsClient client) { Log.d(LOG_TAG, \"onCustomTabsServiceConnected\"); // Setting up CustomTabsSession that is used to build an intent mClient = client; CustomTabsSession session = mClient.newSession(null); // Creating the intent to launch TWA using URL with query params that can be read by the Web App TrustedWebActivityIntentBuilder twaIntentBuilder = new TrustedWebActivityIntentBuilder(Uri.parse(defaultUri); Intent twaIntent = twaIntentBuilder.build(session); // Passing additional custom headers to the intent so they can be read by the Web App Bundle customHeaders = new Bundle(); customHeaders.putString(\"twa_params\", \"cuid=\" + cuid + \"&=\" + af_id\"); customHeaders.putString(\"conversion_data\", conversionData); twaIntent.putExtra(Browser.EXTRA_HEADERS, customHeaders); startActivity(twaIntent); } @Override public void onServiceDisconnected(ComponentName name) { Log.d(LOG_TAG, \"onCustomTabsServiceDisconnected\"); } }; CustomTabsClient.bindCustomTabsService(getApplicationContext(), \"com.android.chrome\", customTabsServiceonnection); } Fetching the conversion data from the client-side JavaScript doesn\u2019t provide an API to allow developers to access headers. Therefore, the server should send the conversion data back to the web activity as a cookie. The server gets the custom headers containing the conversion data, parses the data and sends to the web page as a cookie. When the page loads, a JavaScript snippet should be set in place to fetch the conversion data cookie and customize the content accordingly. For example, if a user installs the app from a campaign for deals on flights, you can populate the web activity with content relevant for the deals that the campaign promotes. // get the conversion data cookie // function taken from https://plainjs.com/javascript/utilities/set-cookie-get-cookie-and-delete-cookie-5/ function getCookie(name) { var v = document.cookie.match('(^|;) ?' + name + '=([^;]*)(;|$)'); return v ? v[2] : null; } // get the cookie var conversionData = JSON.parse(getCookie('conversion_data')); console.log(conversionData); /* conversion data example: { campaign: \"CAMPAIGN_NAME\", // \"None\" if not specified on the link media_source: \"MEDIA_SOURCE\", //\"None\" if not specified on the link  cost_cents_USD : \"0\", is_first_launch: true, install_time: \"2018-12-30 23:59:39.330\", orig_cost: \"0.0\", af_click_lookback: \"7d\", click_time: \"2018-12-30 23:59:09\", cost_cents_USD: \"0\", af_status: \"Non-organic\" } */ To learn more about conversion data use cases, see here.",

As an advertiser, a full picture of brand performance across platforms\u2013web and mobile\u2013is needed. In PBA, brand bundles consolidate the data of mobile and web properties into a single entity for purposes of analytics and raw data. What is a web app? A web app is an entity you have created in AppsFlyer that specifies a website for which you want to measure performance. The web app entity was added to AppsFlyer on February 9, 2022. Prior to that date, you entered the brand bundle domain as a separate setting when creating a brand bundle. Now, you first create a web app that defines the domain, then include that web app when creating a bundle. If you had existing brand bundles on February 9, 2022, you will see that you now have a web app on the My apps page corresponding to each of those bundles. Rest assured! Your web traffic is being attributed just as it was before, and there have been no other changes to PBA dashboards or raw data reports. Brand bundle basics: A brand bundle contains exactly 1 web app (required) and 1 or more mobile apps (optional). An app (web or mobile) can belong only to 1 bundle. Apps can't be deleted from a bundle or moved from one bundle to another without deleting the original bundle.

    "answers": [
      "At a glance: User location is determined using the device IP address which is mapped to the general location of the user (city, state, country, and so on). User location impacts creatives selection, campaign cost, engagement, and user quality. Determining user location User actions in the device are reported to AppsFlyer. The actions (events) contain various data fields including the device IP address. In some cases, the true device IP is masked by a VPN, mechanism like iOS 15 Private Relay, or SKAN postback proxy servers. Consequently, the IP address to geo-location conversion described in this article may be wrong or misleading. AppsFlyer has no control over this. The IP address is converted by AppsFlyer into geo-location information using data provided by Digital Element, the global IP location leader. The geo-location information can include: Territory (country): ISO 3166 (alpha-2) codes, or EU (Europe) or AS (Asia) if no territory-specific information is available. City: This can correlate to a neighborhood or district within the city without being directly related to the actual city boundaries. DMA (designated market area, regions, or geographic areas for television viewing measured by the Nielsen company. Metro codes in CSV file. Region: The geographic region or continent. State or province: See table of localized state names in CSV file. We use the region field in this table. This consists of up to 3 letters or numbers. Postal code. IP address to geo-location tables are updated at regular intervals, usually weekly. Example: Conversion of IP address to geolocation Note regarding the United Kingdom (UK) In the platform, the United Kingdom is denoted using the code UK. The ISO 3166 code for the United Kingdom is GB. UK is reserved, but not allocated, by ISO for the United Kingdom. Location discrepancies In some cases, there may be differences in the derived location of users between AppsFlyer and other platforms, even if other platform uses Digital Element to resolve IP addresses. Possible reasons for location discrepancy are: Database updates: to enable fast attribution, AppsFlyer resolves the IP addresses into location data internally. AppsFlyer fetches the global map from Digital Element periodically and not in real-time. If AppsFlyer and the other platform fetch Digital Element data at different times this can explain differences. ISP changes: Digital Element databases change rapidly as service providers (ISPs) change their IP mappings. Different plans/methods: Digital Element offers different package plans based on the required level of granularity. Other platforms using different Digital Element packages or different methods for defining a device's ID, may provide different results. Proxy, or VPN: If a user implements a VPN or proxy, then we won't know the true user IP address. The Geo resolution will be according to the VPN/proxy address.

    "title": "Cost reporting by click for ad networks",
    "answers": [
      "At a glance: Ad networks can report cost every time an ad is clicked. Advertisers use AppsFlyer\u2019s dashboard as their source of truth for all budget allocation decisions, making it easy to see where to invest. For networks wanting to be visible in that process, sharing cost data with AppsFlyer is an absolute must. Advertisers often check their top-performing partners using sort by ROI. Those that have no cost data always appear at the bottom of the list. How to share cost There are two ways to pass user-level cost data through AppsFlyer attribution URLs: unencrypted and encrypted. Encrypted cost pass allows partners to send cost data in the impression and/or click with displaying the values in plain text. Unencrypted cost can be passed by hardcoding the following 3 parameters to the click URL: af_cost_model=CPI (currently CPI is the only model viewable in AppsFlyer reporting) af_cost_ value={insert CPI value, for example: 1.00}Note: Values less than 1 require a 0 before the decimal, for example: 0.05. af_cost_currency={insert 3 letter currency code. If blank we will assume USD} NOTE: While any cost model can be sent via the attribution link, only CPI is currently supported for presenting cost data on the dashboard. Other cost models are available in the raw reports. An example of an attribution Link with an unencrypted cost pass: https://app.appsflyer.com/id554782625?pid=mediasource_int&c=campaignName&idfa=ABCDEFGH-ABCD-ABCD-ABCD- A12345678910&af_siteid=12345&af_cost_model=CPI&af_cost_value=1.00&af_cost_currency=USD Encrypted cost If you prefer not to reveal the actual cost value in the attribution URL, you can encrypt the cost parameters. The encrypted cost can be passed by following an AES-based encryption method. In addition to the cost model, value, and currency, partners will need a network-specific key to generate the encrypted cost value. Steps for encryption: Request your network encryption key from your Partner Development Manager or reach out to partners@appsflyer.com. Use the AES encryption method (shown below) to encrypt the required 4 values (network key, cost value, cost model, and cost currency) Append the generated encryption value to your AppsFlyer attribution URL in the af_enc_data= parameter. Sample attribution link with encrypted value pass: https://app.appsflyer.com/id554782625?pid=mediasource_int&c=campaignName&idfa=ABCDEFGH-ABCD-ABCD-ABCD-A12345678910&af_siteid=12345&af_enc_data=DvVvQRow%2F2N0LiQGZh0wvwucFygbll9IwAMSN%2B%2BDQxo%3D Note: Only ad networks that perform the cost encryption integration with AppsFlyer can actually send encrypted cost data with their clients' attribution links. AES encryption process To accomplish the encryption, partners must use the AES algorithm, with an ECB block mode, using PKCS5 padding. Then they must Base-64 encode the encrypted data, and finally, URL-encode the result. Networks can use any tech stack to accomplish this. See examples below for PHP, Java, and Python: PHP <?php $f = fopen( 'php://stdin', 'r' ); echo \"Enter private key: \"; $private_key = trim(fgets($f)); echo \"Enter cost model: \"; $cost_model = trim(fgets($f)); echo \"Enter cost value : \"; $cost_value = trim(fgets($f)); echo \"Enter cost currency : \"; $cost_currency = trim(fgets($f)); $params = array( \t'af_cost_model' => $cost_model, \t'af_cost_value' => $cost_value, \t'af_cost_currency' => $cost_currency ); $query_str = http_build_query($params); $block_size = mcrypt_get_block_size(MCRYPT_RIJNDAEL_128, MCRYPT_MODE_ECB); $padding_size = $block_size - (strlen($query_str) % $block_size); $padded_query_str = $query_str . str_repeat(chr($padding_size), $padding_size); $enc_raw = mcrypt_encrypt(MCRYPT_RIJNDAEL_128, $private_key, $padded_query_str, \"ecb\"); $enc_b64 = base64_encode($enc_raw); $enc_url_encoded = urlencode($enc_b64); echo \"\\n\\n\\r\"; echo \"Private key: \" . $private_key . \"\\r\\n\"; echo \"Query string: \" . $query_str . \"\\r\\n\"; echo \"\\n\\r\"; echo \"Encrypted query string: \" . $enc_url_encoded . \"\\r\\n\"; fclose( $f ); ?> Java private static final String CIPHER_ALGORITHM = \"AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding\"; private static final String encryptionKey = \"XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\"; // secret key provided by appsflyer private static final SecretKeySpec key = new SecretKeySpec(encryptionKey.getBytes(), \"AES\"); public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception { String queryParams = \"bid_value=0.01&bid_type=cpc\"; String cipher = encrypt(queryParams); System.out.println(cipher); } public static String encrypt(String str) throws Exception { Cipher cipherEncrypt = Cipher.getInstance(CIPHER_ALGORITHM); cipherEncrypt.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key); byte[] cipher = cipherEncrypt.doFinal(str.getBytes(\"UTF-8\")); String b64 = encode64(cipher); String result = urlencode(b64); return result; } Python import sys import base64 import urllib from Crypto.Cipher import AES def read_number(t): try: start = input(\"enter \" + t + \": \") start = float(start) return start except ValueError: print(\"\\n\\r\" + t + \" must be a number\") exit() def encrypt (secret_key, msg): cipher = AES.new(secret_key, AES.MODE_ECB) ciphertext = cipher.encrypt(msg) return ciphertext def padding (data): length = 16 - (len(data) % 16) data += chr(length)*length return data secret_key = input(\"enter secret key: \").strip() currency = input(\"enter cost currency: \").strip() model = \"CPI\" if len(currency) == 3: currency = currency.upper() else: print(\"currency must have 3 character (e.g. USD)\") exit() start = read_number(\"starting value\") end = read_number(\"final value\") step = read_number(\"step\") if end >= start: while start <= end: msg = \"af_cost_currency=%s&af_cost_model=%s&af_cost_value=%.2f\" % (currency, model, start) msg = padding(msg) enc = encrypt(secret_key, msg) start += step print(msg) print(urllib.quote_plus(base64.b64encode(enc))) Which networks support cost reporting?

Email recipients who click the link are deep linked into your app. ESPs (Email Service Providers) can be excellent sources for segmented user traffic. One of the challenges with ESPs is performing correct attribution and deep linking. ESPs wrap the deep linking URL with their own ESP's click recording domain. This procedure often breaks the functionality of iOS Universal Links and Android App Links. However, deep linking and click recording are still possible with ESPs that support Universal Links and App Links on top of their click recording domain.

    "title": "[Deprecated] Mobile landing page attribution script",
    "answers": [
      "At a glance: This script is deprecated as of December 17, 2020, and is replaced by the OneLink Smart Script. This version continues to work, but will not be updated or changed. The script generates URLs that are embedded behind a button on your mobile website and redirects visitors to download your app. The URLs also support install attribution and deep linking. Migrate to OneLink Smart Script Landing pages are a very common technique among digital marketers. They allow the marketers to capture their leads' details for remarketing, even if these users don\u2019t convert at first. However, for mobile user acquisition, the landing page strategy has upsides and downsides. The upsides: Leads, who eventually get to install, should be more engaged with the app. The more complicated services (for example, financial services) require more explanations to convert their leads, which is enabled by landing pages. The downsides: The longer funnel reduces the final number of converted leads. It is more technically challenging to attribute. The challenges of mobile attribution on landing pages Different media sources require different methods to complete the landing page scenario with the correct attribution data. Last click attribution model may cause loss of correct attribution, if the landing page has its own attribution links. Direct website visitors are recorded as organic, unless the landing page has its own attribution links. Desktop visitors are recorded as organic, unless the landing page has a method of recording their conversions into mobile users. The solution To solve the mentioned landing page attribution problems, you need to implement a javascript flow in your landing page. We offer a sample script implementation that you can use. Make sure to adjust the script to fit your requirements. In some cases, you also need to make some adjustments to your campaigns. The scenarios below cover the requirements for all possible media source cases. Landing page scenarios Follow the implementation instructions below for all the media sources sending leads to your landing pages. Facebook Ads: cross-platform attribution Description: Facebook is an SRN, which doesn't use external attribution links. Upon first app launch, AppsFlyer queries Facebook whether the user has previously (within the last 28 days) engaged with an ad for the app. If the user has engaged with a Facebook ad of the advertiser, Facebook self-attributes. Facebook also attributes cross-platform, meaning that the user may interact with any type of campaign, mobile or not, on any platform, to be self-attributed by Facebook. Conclusion: A lead with the available device ID, coming from Facebook to a landing page, gets correctly attributed to Facebook. This happens regardless of the new click recorded on the landing page.However, when users opt not to share their device ID, as is expected with iOS 14 users during 2021, Facebook's cross-platform attribution may not work anymore. When device ID sharing becomes optional, use the Other SRNs methodfor Facebook Ads. New users who share their device ID would be attributed to Facebook Ads correctly. New users who don't share their device ID would be attributed to \"Facebook_LP\". Instructions: On your Facebook account create a \u201cTraffic\u201d or \"Conversions\" campaign with mobile attribution enabled, sending leads to your landing page. Landing page Android download button - direct link to Google Play. Landing page iOS download button - direct link to iTunes (OR attribution link without the device ID). What the script does The landing page script makes no changes. The script is designed to detect a user coming from Facebook. If it does, it doesn't do anything. It leaves the landing page direct links to the app stores as they are. This prevents another click from being recorded which could affect CTR. In the script, look for a method calledisFacebook() to learn more about what the script does when a user comes from Facebook.",
      "Google Ads: GCLID + offline conversion upload Description: The usual process for install attribution of Google Ads campaigns requires clicking leads to be redirected to the app's store page URL. So, when redirecting leads from Google Ads to a landing page, use a mediator to connect between the mobile install and the original click on the non-mobile Google Ads campaign. Conclusion: The solution for Google Ads has 2 parts. The first part takes care of attributing on AppsFlyer the mobile users that get to the landing page from Google, and install the app from there. It requires tagging the click URLs from Google, identifying them on the landing page and creating a dynamic OneLink with data from the URL. The second part takes care of notifying Google Ads about these mobile installs, using Google's offline conversion upload method. Note This GCLID solution is not officially supported or recommended by Google.In case that Google deprecates the GCLID parameter, we will change the script to support the changes.We recommend following this article, by clicking the Follow button in the article header, to get informed when there is an update to the article or attached script. Instructions: Part 1 - Attributing to Google Ads on AppsFlyer On Google's dashboard - Enable Auto-tagging (here's how). With auto-tagging enabled, the URL to the landing page contains the GCLID parameter. URL example: http://www.yoursite.com/yourlandingpage?gclid={USER_GCLID}  On your landing page load - Activate the generateUrl Javascript function The function (see below) looks for the GCLID parameter and builds a long OneLink URL containing its value under the af_sub1 parameter (you can use any of the subscriber parameters af_sub1 - af_sub5). Landing page download button uses the generated OneLink URL.OneLink URL example: https://yourapp.onelink.me/abcd?pid=google_lp&c={CAMPAIGN_NAME}&af_sub1={USER_PARSED_GCLID} New mobile users are attributed to the google_lp media source and to the CAMPAIGN_NAME campaign (optional). No postback is sent to the media source At this point, the installs are reported in AppsFlyer under the google_lp media source, with the GCLID, but not in Google Ads. Part 2 - Uploading Installs to Google as Offline Conversions This step is only required if you want the conversions to be recorded in the Google Ads platform. For users attributed to google_lp, the AppsFlyer raw data now displays the GCLID value in the af_sub1 column. The GCLID is needed in order to upload offline conversions to Google Ads, you can find more information on the process here). The conversions can be uploaded manually or via an Adwords API (more info on the API here). You can export the CSVs with this information from your AppsFlyer account, or you can get this data from Push API in real-time for every install. Tip You can also see the keywords your users searched for in AppsFlyer's raw data in a similar fashion to getting the GCLID: For keyword recording, you must include the keyword ValueTrack parameter in the final URL from Google Ads to the landing pageURL example: http://www.yoursite.com/yourlandingpage?gclid={USER_GCLI  D}&keyword={USER_KEYWORD}  The Javascript function (see below) looks for the keyword parameter The value is added to the generated OneLink URL under af_keywordsOneLink URL example: https://yourapp.onelink.me/abcd?pid=google_lp&c={CAMPAIGN_NAME}&af_sub1={USER_PARSED_GCLID}&af_keywords={USER_PARSED_KEYWORD} The JS function below already contains the code to parse the keyword parameter as well. What the script does Google Ads carry with them agclid parameter. The script looks for this parameter in the landing page URL. If it sees it, it creates the OneLink such that it reflects that the user comes from Google Ads. The script then puts the OneLink as the link behind the download buttons on the landing page. In the script, look forgclidValue to learn how the script detects users coming from Google Ads and creates the OneLink accordingly.",
      "Other SRNs: add parameter Description: Other SRNs, for example, Snapchat or Twitter, are not cross-platform like Facebook, and require a bit of work to get your mobile users attributed to them. Your campaigns with other SRNs lead your users to the landing page, and you are billed according to clicking leads, unrelated to any derived mobile users. Conclusion: When defining the landing page URL for a campaign on SRNs (besides Facebook and Google Ads), add a Partner ID parameter to the URL, which states the original SRN.The landing page launches a javaScript (see below) that parses that parameter and builds a OneLink URL, which has the Partner ID value. When mobile users click on that OneLink and install, they get attributed to the stated media source. Instructions: On your SRN account - Create a non-mobile campaign When defining the landing page URL, add a Partner ID + landing page parameter to the URL (which is not an AF attribution link). The format is \"&af_pid=srn_lp\". (see example below) On your landing page load - Activate the generateUrl Javascript function The function looks for the af_pid parameter and builds a OneLink URL containing its value under the pid parameter Landing page download button uses the generated OneLink URL New mobile users are attributed to the custom \"Partner ID + landing page\" media source No postback is sent to the media source If you specify the real SRN name, e.g. twitter_int, a postback might be sent to this SRN. This could result in double charges. See the note below for alternative names. The script itself contains logic to prevent you from using these names. Look for var SRNs in the script. You should see a list of SRN names and a condition that checks if pidValue is any of these names. Remove this logic after you are done testing the script. Note If you're sending users to your landing page, we recommend that include the following parameter on the URL of your landing page: For Twitter: use \"&af_pid=twitter_lp\" For Snapchat: use \"&af_pid=snapchat_lp\" For Doubleclick: use \"&af_pid=doubleclick_lp\" For Facebook Post (unpaid): use \"&af_pid=fbpost_lp\" For Oath (formerly Yahoo Gemini): use \"&af_pid=oath_lp\" What the script does The script sees the af_pid parameter on the landing page URL and concludes that the user comes from an SRN or some other custom network. The script creates a OneLink accordingly and sets it as the link behind the download button on the landing page. To learn more about what the script does, look for pidValue in the script.",
      "Attribution links: redirect with af_r Description: Attribution links are used for any media source, which is not an SRN. That includes thousands of integrated partners and any owned media you wish to attribute. Luckily, the solution for landing page attribution when using AppsFlyer's attribution links is simple (and similar to the solution for Facebook). Conclusion: the attribution link redirects the lead to a landing page, and by that also takes care of the correct attribution (if a mobile install follows). All that is left to do is NOT prevent the correct attribution with another last click. Instructions: Create the attribution link for the media source Add the landing page parameter leading to your landing page to the attribution link Add &af_redirect=true to the landing page value under any redirection parameters (that is, af_r, af_ios_url, and af_android_url) in the attribution link.Example: https://yourapp.onelink.me/abcd?pid=email&c={CAMPAIGN_NAME}&af_r=http://www.yoursite.com/yourlandingpage?af_redirect=true Optional- add device ID (GAID / IDFA) to the attribution link to allow attribution by ID matching instead of Probabilistic modeling Landing page Android download button - direct link to Google Play Landing page iOS download button - direct link to iTunes Note The script and HTML sample page provide the option to set one download button that serves both Android and iOS. Read the comments in the script to learn how to implement it.",
      "What the script does The script looks for the af_redirect parameter in the landing page URL. If it sees it, it makes no changes to the download buttons on the landing page. This is because the af_redirect parameter indicates that the user reaches the landing page following a click. Therefore, there is no need for additional attribution links. To learn more about what the script does to handle cases where users reach the landing page after clicking an attribution link, see the method isAFLink() in the script.",
      "Links with utm parameters: dynamic OneLink Description You may have traffic sources, which redirect users to your landing page using links with UTM parameters. Conclusion: If the original URL is NOT an AppsFlyer attribution link, the script searches for theutm_source and utm_campaign parameters in the link. If they exist, the script prepares a OneLink URL, that has them as the media source name (pid) and campaign name (c), respectively. Note that with AppsFlyer attribution links, which also contain UTM parameters, the AppsFlyer parameters are being used, rather than the UTM ones. Instructions: On the media source - Make sure theutm_sourceexists in the link. utm_campaign parameter is optional but highly recommended. On your landing page load - Activate the generateUrl Javascript function The function looks for theutm_source and utm_campaign parameters and builds a OneLink URL containing their values Landing page download button uses the generated OneLink URL New mobile users are attributed to thevalue ofutm_source as themedia source No postback is sent to the media source. What the script does The script looks for UTM parameters in the landing page URL. If it finds any, it converts them to OneLink parameters. This way, campaign information is carried over to the final attribution.",
      "Mobile organic visitors: OneLink with pid=website Description Mobile organic visitors are, by definition, direct mobile web leads from unknown sources. They rarely visit dedicated landing pages but may be the vast majority of mobile installs coming from the advertiser's website. Conclusion: If you have a significant amount of mobile organic traffic from your website, it's highly recommended to record the attribution data of your own traffic. Instructions: To attribute mobile organic visitors, the website should have download or install buttons, with a OneLink attribution link behind them. OneLink enables diagnosing the device type and redirecting the lead to the correct app store according to it. To learn how to set and build OneLink URLs go here. Tip Add \"&pid=website\" to your attribution link to attribute all these visitors to your website.In each page of your website, which has a download/install button with an attribution Link, add \"&c={PAGE NAME}\". This can help you find the highest and lowest converting pages in your website. What the script does Exhausting all other options, the script determines that the user is an organic user that doesn't come from any campaign. The script creates a OneLink that reflects that and puts it as the link behind the download button on the landing page.",
      "Desktop visitors: telephone/email form Description All the options covered above assume the users use mobile devices when engaging with the campaign and the landing page. But what about desktop users? Desktop users may arrive at your landing page/website, and afterward \"independently\" visit the app store with their mobile devices, and install the mobile app. Without the preceding engagement with the mobile devices, it is impossible to attribute these users, and so, they are labeled as \"Organic\". Conclusion: A great solution to this attribution problem is using a text-to-download form on your landing page, only for desktop users. This is to be followed by sending the mobile device an SMS/Email with OneLink URL. Instructions: Identify that a visitor is a desktop user When your user types in their phone number, text them a link to your app, with a OneLink short URL. You can also ask for their email address to email them app download messages. The usage of OneLink is crucial here, as the mobile device platform isn't known when sending the message to the users. OneLink's diagnosis and redirection functionalities take care of this for you. Add \"&pid=desktop_website\" to the OneLink URL to identify this source. Add \"&c={PAGE NAME}\" to help you find the highest and lowest converting pages in your website for desktop users. What the script does The script detects the device or platform the user is on. If it's desktop, the script returns a link to a web form URL and puts it behind the download buttons. When the user clicks download, they are sent to a web form where they fill in their details to get an SMS or an email with a link to download the app. It's up to you to create the web form and provide the URL to it in the script. To learn more, look forisMobileDevice() in the script.",

      " Tip You can implement the javascript snippet using Google Tag Manager. Google Tag Manager makes it easier for you to control when and where the landing page javascript should be used. Instructions Activate the generateUrl script on page load of any page in your web site, which visitors can land on directly, and that has Download button/s for your mobile app/s. Important! By default the Download buttons should direct to the apps pages on iTunes and Google Play. If these links are kept with no change (i.e. visitor from AF attribution link or Facebook), generateUrl returns ' '. Otherwise, it returns the URL to be used with BOTH Download buttons (a single Download button could also be used in this case to cover for both apps with OneLink). Replace the oneLinkURL parameter value with your own basic OneLink URL in the exact format as the placeholder https://yourapp.onelink.me/abcd.MANDATORY to attribute visitors from all SRNs (except Facebook paid ads) and for mobile organic visitors. Replace the webFormURL parameter value with your own web form link. The web form should be able to get the user's email or SMS, and send the user's mobile device a message with a OneLink URL for downloading the app.MANDATORY to attribute desktop visitors. Replace the partnerIDParam parameter value, if you wish mobile organic users to be attributed to another media source than 'website'. By default, users are attributed to the web page they are at when clicking the Download button unless another campaign name is specified in the landing page URL (&c={CAMPAIGN_NAME}).

When email recipients click on the link, they are deep-linked into your app. Introduction ESPs (Email Service Providers) can be excellent sources for segmented user traffic. One of the challenges when using ESPs is recording clicks while persevering deep linking functionality. ESPs wrap the deep linking URL with their own click recording domain.

      "Step 2: Configuring your AppsFlyer SDK Note If you haven\u2019t already done so, make sure you have configured your app to support deep linking with OneLink. After configuring your click recording domain to support Universal Links as described previously, you need to set up your app to deep-link and resolve that Universal Link. Associate the click recording domain in Xcode: Provide the click recording domain to the SDK API setResolveDeepLinkURLs. This API needs to be called before SDK initialization. For more information please refer to SDK documentation here. [[AppsFlyerLib shared] resolveDeepLinkURLs = @[@\"example.com\",@\"click.example.com\"]; When the app is invoked due to a click on the Universal Link, the AppsFlyer SDK resolves the deep link and extracts the underlying OneLink. All deep link parameters are then propagated into the onAppOpenAttribution API for deep link logic execution. Step 3: Send emails with OneLink through EmailLabs Create a OneLink URL on the Link Management page (or manually). You must URL-encode parameter values. [Best practice] Use the following parameters: pid (media source): Use a media source that signifies this usage such as EmailLabs. c (campaign): Campaign name af_dp: The deep link URI scheme you want to deep-link your users into. af_web_dp: Where to redirect users clicking the link on desktop. af_ios_url: Where to redirect users that don\u2019t have the app clicking the link on an iOS device. af_android_url: Where to redirect users that don\u2019t have the app click the link on an Android device.

      "Starting October 29, 2021, user-level attribution data (raw data) of users brought by Facebook after this date will be restricted. Facebook makes this data available to MMPs like AppsFlyer, but not to advertisers. However, if the ad directs users to Google Play Store, attribution fields are available to advertisers in the Google Install Referrer which must be integrated into your app. The fields provided via the referrer populate AppsFlyer raw data reports available to you and enable AppsFlyer to attribute users who don't have an advertising ID (LAT-enabled). Using the referrer mechanism requires AppsFlyer SDK V5.4+ Note! Referrer data has priority over data provided by API and isn't restricted. Data in the referrer is encrypted by Facebook and is decrypted using a key available to you in your Facebook developer account. You must provide us with the decryption key described in the actions required row. Campaign attribution fields available via the referrer: Ad ID Ad name Adset ID Adset name Campaign ID Campaign name Account ID Channel Ad type (this field is not yet available) Note: No other fields are available via the referrer. This solution applies to click-through attribution and not view-through attribution. Referrer data isn't applicable to re-engagement campaigns, as users don't go through the store. When will AppsFlyer roll out this change? Starting October 29, 2021: Facebook restrictions to click-through data (in other words attribution raw data) are implemented. Advertisers can update the referrer decryption key in AppsFlyer. Starting November 3, 2021: AppsFlyer populates raw data and attributes using data provided by the referrer mechanism.",

Note that this is different from any other password or key associated with your AppsFlyer account. The DCR key folder is generally created manually using the interface of your selected cloud service. To get your account's DCR key, click the DCR key button at the top of the main DCR screen. Example After creating the DCR key folder, your bucket/folder structure would look something like this: af-dcr-example-bucket/01bcc5fb/ Creating an input folder path The detailed requirements for creating each element of the input folder path are described in the tabs below. Top-level input folder Though it is not required, best practice is to create a top-level input folder directly beneath the DCR key folder. This folder will be dedicated to files you upload to the DCR. The top-level input folder is generally created manually using the interface of your selected cloud service. This practice is even more highly recommended when you are using the same bucket both for uploading data files (input) and receiving reports (output). You can name this folder anything you want, so long as it complies with the DCR naming requirements. For ease of identification, it is usually named input/.",
      "Example After creating the top-level input folder, your bucket/folder structure might look something like this: af-dcr-example-bucket/01bcc5fb/input/",
      " Second-level folder for each data source You can regularly upload different data source files to the DCR for processing. Each of these data sources must be assigned a separate folder (\"data source folders\"). So, for example, if you plan to upload 2 files to the DCR for processing every day: BI-data.csv and CRM-data.gzip, you would assign each of these data sources a folder. You could choose to call these folders BI-data/ and CRM-data/. The data source folders are generally created manually using the interface of your selected cloud service. Example After creating 2 data source folders, your bucket/folder structure might look something like this: af-dcr-example-bucket/01bcc5fb/input/BI-data/   CRM-data/",
      " Nested subfolders for each date and version We've finally arrived at the part of the folder structure where the real action happens: the folders in which AppsFlyer continually looks for new data files to read into the DCR. Each time you want AppsFlyer to process a data source file and run a report based on it, you upload a new version of the file to the data source folder, within a series of nested subfolders indicating the date and version number (plus one extra subfolder to let AppsFlyer know where the data is): Within each data source folder --> 1 subfolder for each date (\"date folder\") Format: dt=yyyy-mm-dd/ Example: dt=2022-03-10/",
      "Within each date folder --> 1 subfolder for each version on that date (\"version folder\") Format: v=n/ Example: v=1/ Note: The version folder is required even if you only upload the file one time per day. Within each version folder --> 1 subfolder to indicate the location of the data (\"data folder\") Format: data/",
      " In most cases, you would use API calls or other available programmatic means to create the date/version/data folders automatically each time the data source file is uploaded. For additional information, see the API references for your cloud service: AWS, GCS. Since the full folder structure is programmatically created at the time files are uploaded, a realistic example includes both folders and files. See this illustration in the Files tab, below.",
      " Files Data source files Uploaded data source files must meet these name, file format, and location requirements: Must comply with DCR naming requirements CSV or GZIP format. The file underlying GZIP compression must be a CSV file. Number of data source files per data folder: CSV: Maximum of 1 GZIP: Maximum of 1 single-part file. Multi-part GZIP files are supported when named as follows: filename_part01.gzip, filename_part02.gzip, etc.",
      "Data within the source files must meet these requirements: Date and time: Format: yyyy-MM-dd hh:mm:ss Time zone: UTC",
      "Numbers: maximum 2 digits following the decimal point String length: maximum of 256 characters Character limitations: none (all characters are valid) _SUCCESS files Once the upload of a data source file to the data folder is complete, an empty file named _SUCCESS should be uploaded to the version folder. This alerts AppsFlyer that a new file is available to be processed. In most cases, you would use an API script to automatically generate and upload this file. Important! The _SUCCESS file is uploaded to the version folder, outside the data folder. The filename: Must be in ALL CAPS Must be preceded by an underscore (_) Should not have a file extension For multi-part files: Only one _SUCCESS file should be uploaded for all file parts. The _SUCCESS file should be uploaded only after all file part uploads are complete.",
      "Example After uploading source data files on 2 days (and programmatically creating date/version/data folders and _SUCCESS files), your bucket/folder structure might look something like this: af-dcr-example-bucket/01bcc5fb/input/BI-data/  dt=2022-03-10/    v=1/   _SUCCESS   data/    BI-data.csv  dt=2022-03-11/    v=1/   _SUCCESS   data/    BI-data.csv   CRM-data/  dt=2022-03-10/    v=1/   _SUCCESS   data/    CRM-data_part01.gzip    CRM-data_part02.gzip    v=2/   _SUCCESS   data/    CRM-data_part01.gzip    CRM-data_part02.gzip  dt=2022-03-11/    v=1/   _SUCCESS   data/    CRM-data_part01.gzip    CRM-data_part02.gzip    v=2/   _SUCCESS   data/    CRM-data_part01.gzip    CRM-data_part02.gzip",
      " Creating an output folder path The detailed requirements for creating each element of the output folder path are described in the tabs below. Top-level output folder Though it is not required, best practice is to create a top-level output folder directly beneath the DCR key folder. This folder will be dedicated to reports delivered by the DCR. The top-level ouput folder is generally created manually using the interface of your selected cloud service. This practice is even more highly recommended when you are using the same bucket both for uploading data files (input) and receiving reports (output). You can name this folder anything you want, so long as it complies with the DCR naming requirements. For ease of identification, it is usually named output/.",
      "Example After creating the top-level output folder, your bucket/folder structure might look something like this: af-dcr-example-bucket/01bcc5fb/output/",
      " Second-level folder for each report You can regularly receive any number of custom-designed reports from the DCR. Each of these reports must be assigned a separate folder (\"report folders\"). So, for example, if you will be receiving 2 reports from the DCR: conversions report and retargeting report, you would assign each of these data sources a folder. You could choose to call these folders conversions/ and retargeting/. The report folders are generally created manually using the interface of your selected cloud service. Example After creating 2 report folders, your bucket/folder structure might look something like this: af-dcr-example-bucket/01bcc5fb/output/conversions/  retargeting/",
      " Nested subfolders for each date and version (not customer-created) Unlike in the input folder path, you do not create nested date/version folders in the output folder path. AppsFlyer will automatically create this folder structure each time a report is delivered.",

High volume of non-consenting iOS 14.5+ users When AAP is enabled for your app, AppsFlyer doesn't send postbacks to Google Analytics for non-consenting iOS 14.5+ users. In case your app has a large number of such users, there will be a discrepancy between AppsFlyer and Google Analytics dashboards.",
      "Incorrect tracking ID Make sure to specify the correct Google Analytics Tracking ID when integrating with AppsFlyer. If you set an incorrect tracking ID, data might be reported to the wrong dashboard or not reported at all. Example The Google Analytics Tracking ID has the format of UA-123456789-1. This is the tracking ID that you should specify in the integration.UA-123456789, 123456789-1 and 123456789 are incorrect formats.",
      " Customer user ID Google Analytics associates events by Customer User ID. The Customer User ID that AppsFlyer sends by default is GAID or IDFA. Therefore, Google Analytics sees re-installing users (users who install, uninstall and then reinstall) as the same users. Example A user installs your app and then uninstalls it. The user then re-installs the app through a retargeting campaign within the re-attribution window. Google Analytics sees this user as the same user. In User Explorer in Google Analytics, this user has listed under them all of the following: regular-install regular-in-app-event reattribution-install reattribution-in-app-event AppsFlyer, on the other hand, sees this user as two different users: A user that comes from a UA campaign A user that comes from a retargeting campaign In addition, discrepancies might arise if you implement both GA and AppsFlyer SDK. Time zone differences If the time zone of your GA dashboard differs from that of your app's timezone in AppsFlyer, data might not align. Example Your app's dashboard is configured to GMT +13 and your GA dashboard is configured to GMT. This means that your app's dashboard is ahead of your GA's dashboard by one day. Therefore, data that appears in GA dashboard for March 2nd only appears in your app's dashboard if you choose March 3rd in the date range filter.",
      " Duplicate events If events occur in close proximity to each other, both AppsFlyer and Google Analytics might drop them as duplicate events. AppsFlyer'sevent deduplication mechanismis different than the one that Google Analytics uses. Because AppsFlyer and Google Analytics deduplicate events differently, discrepancies in events data might occur.",
      "Session count AppsFlyer counts sessions each time the app is launched or comes back to the foreground. Google Analytics counts sessions according to CID (customer user id) and activity. Example A user launches your app, performs some actions and then sends the app to the background. The user then repeats the process 4 times, each time in an interval of about 5 minutes. To AppsFlyer, this counts as 5 different sessions. However, to Google Analytics this counts as a single session. To learn more about how AppsFlyer and Google Analytics calculate sessions, check the resources below. How AppsFlyer counts sessions Google Analytics sessions",

      "At a glance: Set or change an app-specific time zone in order to view the app's data more closely aligned with your time zone or that of your advertising partners. Understand the effect of time zone changes on the reporting of data within the AppsFlyer platform. Why change the time zone? The default time zone for new apps is UTC (UTC +0). If the app time zone is changed, this affects how data appears in the platform. Scenario: You work in a time zone that is not UTC. However, you want app data aligned to your time zone or to the time zone you selected with other partners like Facebook and Google. Goal: Simplify data comparisons between AppsFlyer and other networks. Solution: Align the time zone in the AppsFlyer platform with the other service providers you use. Accurate Daylight savings time is supported by default (not configurable). Agencies and ad networks: Agencies: view data using the time zone set by the app owner. Agencies can't set the time zone. Ad networks: view data using UTC at all times irrespective of the timezone set by the advertiser. Changing the time zone An admin user can make time-zone changes. To change the app time zone: In AppsFlyer, go to Configuration > App settings. In Localization >Time Zone, select UTC. Click Save settings, then wait 48 hours. Note! the setting can only be set once per day. Thereafter, the setting is unavailable. Go to Configuration > App settings. In Localization >Time Zone> select a time zone (per city/country). Click Save settings.Change takes effect at the beginning of the next day at 00:00 UTC. Example October 24 at 22:00, the time zone is changed. October 25 at 00:00 UTC, the change takes effect.

The APK package name (for example: com.shop.app) is used for the redirection, so make sure the APK package name exists in the third-party app store before you select it. Only the package name is extracted from the Android app to redirect users. For example, if the AppsFlyer name includes a channel as well, like com.shop.app-store, only com.shop.app is extracted.

Once the SDK integration is complete, any team member with access to the AppsFlyer dashboard can perform basic testing. Developers can utilize debug logs in the development environment. This article describes the testing procedures from the dashboard and gives links to the documentation that the marketer should provide to the developer. Testing methods The following sections describe the various tests to perform and the available methods. Testing from the dashboard To test the SDK integration from the dashboard, you must first register a test device (Android or iOS). This allows you to use the same device repeatedly and prevents installs from being recorded as reinstalls. You should perform the following: Test organic installs. Test basic integration functionality (non-organic installs, in-app events, and retargeting).Available methods include: SDK integration test page: A wizard in the AppsFlyer dashboard that leads you through the process of running each test. Tests using attribution links: All non-SRN ad networks and owned media sources rely on AppsFlyer attribution links; therefore, conducting tests using attribution links is highly recommended. You create attribution links, and then run tests to verify that the SDK is attributing non-organic installs and in-app events to the correct media sources.

      " 3. Support for SKAdNetwork attribution SKAdNetwork is a class used by iOS that validates advertiser-driven app installations. The app install validation process involves the source app and the advertised app. A source app is an app that participates in ad campaigns by displaying ads signed by an ad network. Configuring your app to display ads is not within the scope of the AppsFlyer SDK. To configure, you must follow the iOS instructions. For configuring the advertised app, the AppsFlyer SKAdNetwork Solution uses the SKAdNetwork to provide advertisers and ad networks with LTV analytics, reports, and postbacks, while maintaining user privacy. On launching the app for the first time, the AppsFlyer platform, using the configuration set by the marketer, instructs the SDK how to set the SKAdNetwork conversion value. To use the SKAdNetwork Solution: The developer does nothing. AppsFlyer SDK automatically calls the necessary SKAdNetwork APIs, meaning registerAppForAdNetworkAttribution() and updateConversionValue(). The developer must not call them. Don't allow other SDKs to call SKAdNet APIs. Doing so can delay iOS in sending the postback to AppsFlyer and change the conversion value which we use to populate the SKAdNetwork dashboard with user quality measurement data as configured by the marketer in the dashboard. The marketer needs to configure SKAdNetwork measurement in AppsFlyer. There is no other action or registration process required by either the developer or the marketer in the App Store.",

The developer then gathers information from the AppsFlyer SDK for deep linking and customizing the user experience. Issues with links in emails from ESPs ESPs wrap links in emails with their own links. They do so in order to measure and report engagements. However, this practice could break the OneLink flow if not handled properly. The app doesn't launch and it results in a broken user experience. Some ESPs support iOS Universal Links while wrapping the links with their own measurement links. Apps launch when users click on links in the emails. However, the OneLink flow still breaks which results in the following: No measurement of engagements (clicks) on AppsFlyer end App Launch is not attributed to a click AppsFlyer SDK doesn't pass attribution data to the App developer The solution by AppsFlyer AppsFlyer joins forces with prominent ESPs in order to solve the problem with broken deep linking. The solution combines several technologies: ESP Link Branding (viaBranded Links) Apple App Site Association AppsFlyer SDK The combination of these technologies allows the SDK to resolve the underlying OneLink, even though it is wrapped in other links. As the SDK resolves the underlying OneLink, it is able to provide the developer with the necessary information for deep linking and customizing the user experience. The following ESPs fully support AppsFlyer solution for deep linking with Universal Links in emails: Braze Iterable Oracle Responsys Salesforce Sendgrid Other ESPs require some additional work during integration to ensure a smooth OneLink deep linking experience.",
      "Android App Links Android developers might experience a similar problem with App Links. However, deep linking using URI scheme is still widely supported on Android. What this means is that developers can still use URI scheme to deep link from emails that are sent by ESPs."

      "At a glance: Use SKAN recommendations to optimize your conversion value settings and receive more accurate post-install activity measurements. Overview SKAdNetwork (SKAN), part of Apple iOS, lets advertisers measure campaign performance while simultaneously preserving user privacy. With SKAdNetwork, post-install activity is measured using only numbers\u2014conversions values\u2014 between 0-63. The AppsFlyerConversion Studio provides you with maximum flexibility to make every conversion value (CV) count. You determine precisely what measurement data should be encoded within the CV\u2014including what activities should be measured during the post-install period, and for how long. However, given the limited measurement capabilities of SKAN, it can be difficult to decide what to measure (for example, revenue, in-app events, or retention) and how to best utilize the CVs between 0-63. Decisions may be based on estimates, trial and error, or machine learning tools that use internal app data. And the measurements are not always as accurate as they could be. AppsFlyer SKAN recommendations: Gives suggestions to improve your current CV settings and enhanceyour CV efficiency and measurement accuracy. Solves the difficulties you may have in making CV settings decisions. Are based on your specific vertical, geo, SKAN and non-SKAN app data, and user behavior. Recommendations Revenue Understanding revenue recommendations Having the right revenue configuration schema is crucial to getting accurate revenue reporting. The conversion value (CV) configuration you have to report revenue isn't necessarily 100% accurate, and SKAN-reported revenue may differ from actual revenue. For example, the actual (AF reported) ARPPU may be $10, but your current CV configuration reports SKAN ARPPU of $7, meaning SKAN underreports revenue for each paying user by $3. AppsFlyer checks your non-SKAN revenue data (which is 100% accurate) on a daily basis, to make customized recommendations you can implement to improve the accuracy of your SKAN revenue reporting. The recommendations are also based on your saved activity window configuration in Conversion Studio, as well as your specific vertical, geo, and app user behavior. The recommendations: Give you a clear picture of campaign performance with accurate revenue reporting. Save conversion values by using fewer ranges to accurately measure revenue. Take into account both in-app purchases and ad revenue. Revenue recommendations layout",

The Conversion Paths dashboard provides a marketing analysis of mobile and web touchpoints across channels, platforms, and devices encountered by a user on their path to conversion. These include retargeting touchpoints. Conversion path analysis provides advertisers with insights into the interaction of acquisition channels on the user path to performing a conversion event enabling advertisers to make data-driven media mix optimizations.

    "title": "Texting desktop users a link to your mobile app",
    "answers": [
      "At a glance: Convert desktop users to mobile app users using SMS vendors and OneLink. Introduction If your brand has both a web app and a mobile app, desktop web users might decide at some point that they want to install the mobile app. To help them do so and for better user experience, you can text them a direct link to the app. This is the quickest way to help them install the app. This way, they don't have to open the app store on their mobile, find your app and install it. When you save users time and effort, they are more likely to convert and install your mobile app. Note We offer another solution for desktop-to-web conversion that simply requires you to post a QR code (generated from your OneLink) to your desktop site. Requirements To text desktop users a link to your mobile app you need the following: An SMS provider account like Twillio, AWS SNS, or bandwidth.com. A backend environment where you can handle the logic for texting links to users. A multi-platform custom link such as OneLink. Setting up The following section is a high-level overview of the requirements discussed earlier. SMS provider account to text a link to the app Create an account with any SMS provider. Then, you can send links to your mobile app to a large number of users at any given time. See the list that follows for some popular providers that support a variety of programming languages and have comprehensive APIs for various use cases: Twilio bandwidth AWS SNS Braze Airship Swrve Mixpanel A backend environment to communicate with the SMS provider SMS providers require authentication tokens to use their services. In addition, user phone numbers are sensitive data. Due to these aspects, the best thing to do is to handle everything from your backend. A multi-platform custom link A multi-platform custom link redirects the user to the correct app store or destination according to the device they have. This way you can send the same link to any user no matter what device they have. Texting the app to users This section describes the flow of texting users a link to the app. It also explains how to follow up on the number of users that install the app from the link. Create a multi-platform OneLink Create a multi-platform OneLink to put in the SMS. When you create the link, you have the option to define the media source and campaign. We suggest that you set the media source and campaign as follows: media source: website campaign: text-me-the-app When sending OneLink in SMS, it's best to use the short link version of the OneLink. To learn how to create the link, see here. Set up an SMS topic in your SMS provider account In this step, you create an SMS topic or message that contains the OneLink to the app. This SMS is sent when users fill out and submit a form with their phone number. When users submit the form, your backend receives the request and communicates with the SMS provider API to send the link. Set up a web form to collect phone numbers On your website, at pages of your choice, set up a call-to-action to prompt users to install your app. The call-to-action should open a web form through which users can submit their phone numbers. Apply logic in your backend On submitting the form, the website should send a request to your backend. The backend receives the phone number and sends a request to the SMS provider to text a link to the app to the user's phone. Refer to your SMS provider API and documentation to learn how to create the logic in your backend. How Attribution works when sending a link to the app There's no way to include the advertising ID when texting desktop users a link to the app. Therefore, AppsFlyer resorts to attribution using Probabilistic modeling. AppsFlyer limits the lookback window for Probabilistic modeling clicks to maintain accuracy. The limits are: iOS: up to 24 hours Android (Google Play): up to one hour Android (out-of-store): up to 24 hours Encourage your users to install as close as possible to the click so that AppsFlyer can accurately attribute the install to the texted link. You can do so by offering coupons, discounts, or game credits. People-based attribution There are more ways, other than texting a link to the app, in which users convert from web to app. It's not always clear where these users come from and what media sources and campaigns contribute to their conversion. To get more insights into how many web users convert to mobile apps users, and what media sources and campaigns are involved in the process, use People-based attribution. People-based attribution (PBA) puts together data from both web and mobile app campaigns. The consolidated data helps you analyze user journeys across platforms and user transition from web to mobile apps. To learn more, see here."

    "answers": [
      "At a glance: Learn how re-attributions and re-engagements reflect in the conversion data for SRNs and non-SRN user journeys. Retargeting conversion Retargeting includes two types of conversions, re-attribution or re-engagement. Tip Conversion data for retargeting doesn't always give a clear indication as to the type of conversion. See alternative conversion data sources. Re-attribution with SRNs When a user is re-attributed through an SRN, the conversion data payload doesn't indicate that this is a retargeting campaign. Since SRNs don't use attribution links, there is no way to set an is_retargeting=true parameter in the attribution link. For SRNs that do support retargeting, AppsFlyer determines whether the user should be re-attributed or not. What this means is that there is no way to determine, on the SDK level, if an install comes from a retargeting campaign. The only way is to set the campaign name such that it indicates a retargeting campaign. Note Setting the campaign name such that it indicates retargeting is not a foolproof method. See examples to learn more. Re-attribution with regular ad networks Attribution to ad networks relies on attribution links. Whether regular attribution links or OneLink, with retargeting the attribution link always has the is_retargeting=true parameter set in it.

      " Re-attribution with deferred deep linking Oftentimes, you want to deep link re-attributed users who, by definition of being re-attributed, don't have the app installed. For example, You set a campaign that aims to bring back users who uninstalled the app. The campaign promotes a product or service and you want to serve the users with content related to the product or service that you advertise. This is referred to as Deferred Deep Linking. Conversion data payload for Deferred Deep Linking comes from the onConversionDataSuccess method. Deferred deep linking with SRNs Deep Link parameters defined in SRNs campaigns are not available outside of the SRN. This includes the af_dp parameter, which holds the scheme path in the app. Therefore, to implement deferred deep linking, additional logic must be applied for SRN campaigns. Use the data inonConversionSuccess response, such as campaign, adset, adgroup, to programmatically redirect your users.

Example The app is an eCommerce app that specializes in sportswear. A user who doesn't have the app installed engages with an ad and installs the app. Once the app launches, the SDK returns the conversion data. The developer makes the app open the summer running shoe collection (campaign) activity in the store and serves the running shoes for women category (adset).",

To overcome this limitation, you can set the campaign name to indicate a re-engagement. Re-engagement with deep linking A major part of Re-Engagement is to send the user to a specific activity. For example, if you advertise some product or sale. In such cases, you want to send the users who click the ad straight to the app activity for this product or sale. To do so, you use Deep Linking. The conversion data in Deep Linking is really important. It holds the information necessary for the developer to customize the user experience and send them to the correct activity. Re-engagement: deep linking with SRNs Conversion data is not available when a re-engaged user comes from an SRN. The developer needs to use the SRN methods to get it upon app launch.",
      "Re-engagement: deep linking with ad networks When a user is re-engaged and the app launches, the following conversion data is available in the onAppOpenAttribution method: For both iOS and Android, when using the short version of OneLink, the conversion data is a structured map of all the parameters on the link: Example: { af_dp: \"superapp://Deeplink\", pid: \"media_source_name\" c: \"campaign_name\", link: \"https://abcd.onelink.me/12ab/12ab34c\" is_retargeting: true } The app developer can use such parameters, like af_dp and campaign name, to send the user to a specific activity and serve the relevant content.",
      " Important! We recommend using the short version of OneLink. Click here to learn more. Another reason to use the short version of OneLink is the conversion data structure that the long version returns. When using the long version, the conversion data is a map with a single field called link that holds the entire long OneLink. { \"link\": \"https://abcd.onelink.me/12ab?pid=media_source&c=campaign_name&is_retargeting=true&af_dp=superapp%3A%2F%2FDeepLink\" } ",
      "Alternative conversion data sources Push API offers a detailed conversion payload that indicates re-attribution or re-engagement. Push API payloads include a field called re_targeting_conversion_type. This field indicates the type of conversion, either re-attribution or re-engagement. To learn more, see our Push API guide. Raw Data Reports also contain indicators for the type of conversion. In the raw data report for retargeting conversions, there is a column called Event Name. The value in this column is either re-engagement or re-attribution according to the type of conversion. Examples of mixed user acquisition and re-attribution Examples A user installs your app and then uninstalls it. The act of installation puts the user in a re-attribution window. You set a user acquisition(not retargeting) campaign with Facebook. You also set the AppsFlyer integration with Facebook to allow retargeting.While still in the re-attribution window, the user sees the ad, clicks on it, and reinstalls the app. As far as AppsFlyer sees it, the user is a re-attributed user.This is due to two factors: The configuration with Facebook allows retargeting The user is in the re-attribution window In this case, the campaign name doesn't indicate re-attribution. Let's take the same example, only this time the user is outside the re-attribution window. In this case, the install is a new non-organic install. Let's look at another example. You set a retargeting campaign on Facebook. Some users come across the campaign and install the app. However, these users install the app for the first time. Such users are not considered re-attributed users. Instead, AppsFlyer considers them as users that come from a user acquisition campaign."

    "answers": [
      "At a glance: The sessions metric is used by advertisers to measure app user engagement during a given period. Sessions counting principles The number of sessions, AKA launch, performed by users is an important metric and used as a measure of user engagement with the app. It is available via several reports and dashboards. Sessions is used to derive the following metrics: Daily active users (DAU) Monthly active users (MAU) Retention Loyal users using the default setting of 3-app opens Note! In the case of organic sessions, the metric is available in the Activity and Cohort dashboards but isn't available in the Overview dashboard. Sessions calculation The sessions metric is calculated using the af_app_opened eventreported by the SDK. A minimum time between sessions mechanism regulates which sessions are counted on the server-side. The af_app_opened event displays as launch in sessions raw data available via Data Locker. Sessions isn't available via other reporting tools. For ease of understanding, in this article, we'll use the term af_app_opened. Sessions reporting A session is reported by the SDK when any of the following occur: A user launches the app. When the app is brought to the foreground from the background. The developer can alter the reporting behavior by calling setMinTimeBetweenSessions. An explicit session report by the developer in Android apps. For example, this is implemented by utility apps that are always in the background. Sessions metric The sessions metric is counted after considering a minimum time between sessions mechanism with a default duration of 10 minutes as described in the example that follows. Minimum time between sessions mechanism The mechanism impacts the sessions count. Note! Consider that if the Minimum time between sessions is long, more than one hour, and users don't open the app many times a day, then some session-related metrics, such as DAU and retention can be impacted. This is especially true in the case of apps where users typically open the app once a day. Description and example The mechanism regulates which sessions are counted. A session is counted if the minimum time allowed between sessions has passed. The flow is as follows: A session is counted \u2192 A countdown timer starts \u2192 Sessions reported while the timer is counting down are disregarded. Example Assumption: The minimum allowed time between sessions setting is 10 minutes.",

Server-side: Sessions reported by the app are counted and recorded after considering the minimum time between sessions mechanism. Counted sessions are attributed using the same attribution rules as other in-app events. Explicit sessions reporting by the developer (Android apps only) Use logSessionin Android to explicitly report a session. An equivalent call is not available in iOS. Apps that work in the background continuously may require some logic implemented by the developer to report sessions. For example, utility apps like battery savers, launchers, screen locks, and antivirus apps. For these types of apps, consider reporting a session daily at midnight or some other interval appropriate to the app. In other cases, you may want to count sessions when users perform some in-app action, such as pressing the clear memorybutton and so on. Setting minimum time between app launches In the SDK, set the minimum time that can lapse between two sessions for them to be reported separately. Use setMinTimeBetweenSessions, meaning af_app_opened event (Android, iOS), to control the minimum amount of time that must occur between sessions so that each of them is reported. [Default] five-seconds. Meaning at least 5 seconds must elapse before another session is reported. The API allows setting the minimum required time between sessions."

Paste the OneLink in the browser address bar and hit enter. For example, <OneLinkSubdomain>.onelink.me/.well-known/apple-app-site-association. When you do so, the AASA file is downloaded to your computer. You can open it using any simple text editor. Upload this AASA file to Sailthru. For more information and to learn more about the contents of this file, see Sailthru's guide. Setting up your app to support Universal Links Step 1: Associating click domains in Xcode In Xcode, click on your project. Click on Capabilities. Turn Associated Domains on. Click the + sign and add your click domain. For example, applinks:click.example.com. Step 2: Resolving deep links The SDK needs to resolve the OneLink behind the click domain to get the campaign details. The details are returned in the onAppOpenAttribution method. To resolve click domains: Make sure that your SDK version is at least 4.9.0. List the click domains in the SDK property resolveDeepLinkURLs. This property needs to be set before SDK initialization. For more information, see SDK documentation here. Objective-C Swift [AppsFlyerTracker sharedTracker].resolveDeepLinkURLs = @[@\"example.com\",@\"click.example.com\"]; AppsFlyerTracker.shared().resolveDeepLinkURLs = [\"example.com\", \"click.example.com\"] \t",
      "Add the following code so that the SDK can resolve the click recording domain: Objective-C Swift Add this code in AppDelgate.m - (NSDictionary *)allHTTPHeaderFieldsForResolveDeepLinkURL:(NSURL *)URL { \t\tif ([URL.host isEqual: @\"click.example.com\"]) { \t\t\treturn [NSDictionary dictionary]; \t\t} \t\telse { \t\t\treturn nil; \t\t} \t} Add this code in AppDelgate.swift func allHTTPHeaderFields(forResolveDeepLinkURL URL: URL!) -> [String : String]! { \t\tif (URL.host == \"click.example.com\") { \t\t\t/// Change User-Agent \t\t\treturn [:] \t\t} else { \t\t\treturn nil; \t\t} \t} \t",
      " Sending your first email Create a OneLink URL on the Link Management page (or manually). When creating the OneLink URL, make sure to URL-encode all parameter values. The following parameters are highly recommended to use: pid (media source) - Use a media source that signifies this usage such as Email. c (campaign) - The name of the campaign you want to measure. af_dp - The deep link URI scheme you want to deep link your users into. af_web_dp - Where to redirect users clicking the link on desktop. af_ios_url - Where to redirect users that don\u2019t have the app clicking the link on an iOS device. af_android_url - Where to redirect users that don\u2019t have the app click the link on an Android device. Place the OneLink URL in the email that you create in Sailthru. Example: <a href=\"greatapp.onelink.me/abcd/1234567\">Download my great app!</a> At this stage, Sailthru wraps the above link with the click domain that you set in the previous steps. Any click on the click domain redirects to the OneLink attribution link. If the app is installed on the user's device, the click domain deep-links into the app.",
      "Example URL parameters are not URL encoded in this example, just for the sake of readability: https://greatapp.onelink.me/abcd?pid=Email&c=Spring_Newsletter&is_retargeting=true& \taf_dp=testapp://path/to/content&af_web_dp=https://www.example.com/path/to/content& \taf_ios_url=https://www.example.com/path/to/content&af_android_url=https://www.example.com/path/to/content Testing your links After following all the required steps mentioned above, creating the appropriate OneLink URL, and placing it in an email, send yourself a test email. What should you expect? If you have the app installed, the app should be invoked. If the relevant AppsFlyer SDK deep linking APIs are implemented you should be deep linked into the relevant content. In addition, a click should appear in both the AppsFlyer dashboard, attributed to the provided media source and campaign, and also in Sailthru data."

      "At a glance: Learn how advertisers can attribute affiliate marketers and report relevant data back to them. Challenges Affiliate marketers can influence crowds and create a lot of traffic for app owners. However, compared with ad networks and owned media, working with mobile affiliate marketers is more challenging. Attribution links Click ad-networks don't require advertiser involvement; they use the single attribution link created by AppsFlyer. Advertisers working with affiliate marketers must create and distribute a OneLink custom link per affiliate. Reconciliation In AppsFlyer, ad networks are easily configured to receive app install and in-app event postbacks for their traffic. Reconciliation between ad networks and the advertiser is automatic and up-to-date. Affiliate marketers usually don\u2019t have the option to get postbacks from AppsFlyer, so the advertiser must carry out reconciliation with them periodically. Attributing affiliate marketers This section explains how advertisers successfully attribute and reconcile affiliate marketers who bring mobile traffic. To attribute an affiliate marketer: Manually prepare a specific OneLink per affiliate. See setup recommendations.OR Manually prepare a single OneLink and give each affiliate a specific param to append to the link to identify them. We recommend either the c (campaign) param or af_sub[1-5] params. For example: c=affiliate1 or af_sub1=affiliate1.OR Use OneLink API for links created in your systems. Recommended principals are the same as for manual OneLink setup. Setup recommendations The following describes the recommendations for manual custom link creation. However, the recommended principles also apply for using OneLink API. Go to OneLink custom links > Add custom link. Details tab Begin with the Details tab. Enter the affiliate name as the link name; it will be easy to recognize in the OneLink template list of links. Customize the short URL with the affiliate name; this can improve affinity with their followers. Attribution tab Now, follow these steps on the Attribution tab. Go to the Owned media source drop-down list. Select Custom and enter affiliates. This enables aggregating all affiliate traffic under one media source. Go to the Campaign name field. Enter the affiliate name.This enables you to easily see and compare all affiliates' data under the affiliates media source. [Optional] Add custom parameters to the link.Example: An affiliate uses a CRM system that gets postbacks. Therefore, you can add the postback URL as a custom parameter to the attribution link. Send the custom link to the affiliate marketer. Specific cases For a campaign that uses retargeting, read how to enable retargeting attribution for custom links. For a campaign that uses app-launching AND the affiliate advertises in social network apps, read how to create a landing page for social media apps.

    "title": "Impact of Apple Limit Ad Tracking on attribution (before iOS 14)",
    "answers": [
      "At a glance: Impact of iOS Limit Ad Tracking (LAT) on different types of UA media sources. Relevant only for devices before iOS 14. Related reading: Quickstart guide & FAQ to iOS 14, ATT, and SKAdNetwork Impact of LAT on attribution The purpose of iOS Limit Ad Tracking (LAT) is to improve user privacy. Before iOS 10, when users actively selected LAT, iOS sent a flag indicating the user\u2019s wish. However, Apple\u2019s IDFA identifier was still there and not all companies honored the requests (this is still the case in Android). Apple also allowed companies to use the ID for frequency capping, attribution, conversion events, estimating the number of unique users, advertising fraud detection, and debugging. Starting iOS 10 Apple sends a string of zeroes in place of the user IDFA. More than 99% of iOS users have iOS 10+, out of which 25% enable LAT. This article relates to those users. The figure displays, based on AppsFlyer analysis, that the percentage of iOS LAT users increased from 16% at the start of 2019 to 25% in the middle of 2020. Starting iOS 14, LAT is deprecated and has been replaced by ATT. The effect of LAT on attribution To understand the real effect of LAT on attribution and media sources let's look at three main cases: Media sources that can be attributed with Probabilistic modeling Media sources that don't support Probabilistic modeling attribution Apple Search Ads Measuring installs with Probabilistic modeling Starting iOS 14.5+ probabilistic modeling is limited to the context of owned media, cross-promotion, and consented web-to-app flows. 99% of media sources and 100% of custom attribution links for owned media use attribution links. LAT obviously affects attribution companies\u2019 ability to record installs using ID matching. The loss of 25% of attributed installs could be very troubling for app owners using these attribution links. Luckily, a fallback mechanism for ID matching can be used - Probabilistic modeling attribution. Probabilistic modeling is less accurate than ID matching, and therefore the attribution window is shorter, usually 24 hours. In mobile app install campaigns, the vast majority of the first app opens occur within 1-2 hours, in which case the Probabilistic modeling method is extremely accurate. However, some loss of attributed installs is unavoidable. Advertisers actually gain somewhat from this. When advertisers run on a cost per install (CPI) pricing model, and not on exposure (CPM) or clicks (CPC), they receive ~2.5% free organic installs! Measuring installs without Probabilistic modeling What happens when a LAT user clicks on an ad served by a media source that relies solely on ID matching - among them top sources such as Facebook Ads, Google Ads, and Snapchat? When that user installs and launches the app, the mobile attribution company\u2019s SDK cannot pull its IDFA, and so the media source is unable to perform ID matching and identify the user as their own. This results in a failed attribution and a free organic user for the app owner. This is true for CPI and CPA campaigns only, as media sources need to carve out their installs quota out of the 75% non-LAT users only, but still may serve ads to the 25% LAT users for free. This is a potential increase of about 33% (100/75) free installs for advertisers. It makes sense that these giants of mobile app advertising would soon reach a solution to minimize the effects of LAT and ATT on them. For example, such a solution could be to simply stop serving LAT users with mobile app install ads, or by implementing some Probabilistic modeling API. In conclusion, on CPI or CPA campaigns, media sources that do not support Probabilistic modeling may contribute up to 33% free installs to app owners. Apple Search Ads Apple Search Ads is a powerful source for paid installs for iOS app owners. In contrast with all other mobile media companies, Apple knows exactly who its mobile users are, even if they\u2019re LAT users since it can easily use the iTunes account ID. Apple Search Ads' attribution is therefore unharmed by LAT users, while AppsFlyer attributes them as organic users (or to another engagement, if it occurred). However, audience-targeted Apple Search ads campaigns don\u2019t serve ads to LAT users, so the problem is confined to non-targeted campaigns only. In conclusion, non-targeted campaigns on Apple Search Ads may bring a high percentage of non-attributed users. Note Apple users aged 18 and younger are always LAT. Summary The surprising conclusion from this analysis is that the introduction of LAT on iOS 10 has actually increased the percentage of non-organic installs app owners receive! In AppsFlyerdata, the added installs are unattributed and appear as organic installs. Note the following important tips: The app owner MUST buy CPI (or CPA) campaigns to enjoy this increase; CPM and CPC campaigns move the beneficial effect from the app owner to the media companies Media sources that do not use Probabilistic modeling (mainly SRNs) may contribute up to 33% free \"organic\" users, but don't count on it. Targeting in Apple Search Ads installs campaigns is very important as, without it, many paid users are not attributed. ",
      "Caution As demonstrated, although Apple\u2019s LAT is good for app owners, it has the potential to harm ad networks\u2019 bottom line by forcing them to expose mobile app ads to more users than previously needed. The good news is that when mobile installs are recorded by an attribution company with a good Probabilistic modeling solution, the effect of LAT is rather marginal.",
      "Note Android has a similar limitation called \"Opting out of ad personalization\". However, currently, the LAT percentage in Android devices is marginal, with less than 2% of users."

      "At a glance: Use AppsFlyer to A/B test media sources, campaigns, creatives, targeting, and ad placement. What is A/B testing? A/B testing is a method used by marketers to test different elements of their ads and campaigns. Each ad contains elements (targeting, visual, texts), which may affect the conversion rates of potential users. Finding the best performing variations of your ad elements may have a significant impact on the bottom line of your mobile marketing efforts. This article explains how advertisers can perform A/B tests using AppsFlyer, to find the best performing ad elements. How to A/B test mobile campaigns To A/B test an element, split your mobile traffic 50/50 between two sources showing the identical offer. Next, create two variations of the element that you want to test. After sufficient traffic has flowed through, you can compare the results of your existing version (control) to the new version (variation). The following steps apply to an A/B test you run using AppsFlyer. Setup: Select the element to test.In this article, we explain about A/B testing creatives, ad placements, media sources, and campaigns. Create two identical campaigns (or ads), and then vary a single element within the ad. For example, call-to-action button copy. To test the impact of the variation on install conversion rates, split the traffic equally between the two campaigns.If full impression data is available for both sources, divide installations by impressions to calculate the install conversion rates. To test the impact of the variation on the quality of users, post-installation, you can send different amounts of traffic to the two campaigns. Drive sufficient traffic to each campaign to reach statistical significance, that means at least 50 installs per campaign. Use theA/B testing significance calculator. Analysis: Use AppsFlyer's dashboard and data to compare the performance of the key KPIs between the two campaigns. Select the winning variation and use it in your live campaigns. A/B testing creatives and targeting Creatives contain many elements with varying impact on user conversion rates, including copy, images, colors, fonts, buttons, etc. Targeting parameters, like country, age, or gender, may also have a major impact on conversion rates. And for iOS 15+, you can also have up to 35 custom product pages. A/B testing these elements can help you find which factors have the biggest impact on improving user conversion rates. Below we explain two methods of A/B testing using: A single media source Multiple media sources",
      " Method Pros Cons",
      " A/B testing with a single media source Quick setup Easy to test install conversion rate",
      " Results may only apply to users of the specific media source May take longer to test",
      " A/B testing across multiple media sources Fast results Results apply to users from all media sources",
      " Need to update attribution links in multiple places",
      "Method 1: A/B testing with a single media source Setup: Select a trusted media source with sufficient traffic. Create two campaigns or Smart Banners in AppsFlyer by using one of the following methods: Vary the campaign that is the name that is \"c\" parameter in the attribution link. Alternately you can create two ad sets (\"af_adset=\") within a campaign or single ads (\"af_ad=\") within an ad set. Note: In Smart Banners, you can also A/B test by putting different parameters for each banner within the same banner group. For iOS 15+, you can also test the efficacy of different custom product pages, by sending different OneLink URLs to different product pages. Learn more",

      " A/B testing ad placement on mobile web The location of banners for your apps on mobile websites may significantly impact user conversion rates. In most cases, advertisers use their own mobile websites to convert visitors into mobile users. With the AppsFlyer Smart Banners feature, you can set up mobile web banners quickly and easily. In addition, the feature also enables you to easily run A/B tests to determine the best placement for converting website visitors into mobile users. Setup: Implement Smart Banners in your mobile website. For each new visitor, determine whether to show the banner at the top or bottom of the page. Make sure to split the traffic 50/50 between the two.Developer Tip - A simple method for splitting your website traffic is to use a visitor counter, and then check whether the counter value is odd (option A) or even(option B) for each new visitor. Set the banner location and attribution link according to the determined location using the Smart Banners' SDK API ShowBanner.Example: showBanner({ bannerContainerQuery: \"#document.body\", additionalParams:{ af_sub5: \"top\"}}) Analysis: Download the raw data reports for installs or in-app events. Use your selected subscriber parameter (e.g. af_sub5) column to filter and sort your data. Compare the performance of the two ad placements, i.e. which placement got more installs or post-install events. A/B testing media sources Helping advertisers identify the best (and worst) performing media sources for their apps is what AppsFlyer was built for. However, if advertisers fail to compare media sources correctly, they risk reaching the wrong conclusions about traffic quality. Setup: Create a single ad creative for BOTH media sources. Define an ad for each media source, with the same exact audience targeting parameters. You can send different amounts of traffic to the 2 media sources. Analysis: If the ads being tested are the only ones running on both media sources, use AppsFlyer's dashboard and data to easily compare your key KPI between the two sources.Otherwise: Go to AppsFlyer's Retention Report, Cohort Report, Master API or Pivot Table. Group by Media Source -> Campaign -> Ad set -> Ad. Compare KPIs to identify the top-performing media source.",
      "Example 1 and 2 are different ads on the same media source. Compare a single KPI for them, for example, retention day 4 rate, to A/B test creatives, targeting, or ad placement. 2 and 3 are ads on different media sources. If the creatives and targeting of the ads are identical, comparing a single KPI enables A/B testing the media source. Using audiences split for easy A/B testing of media sources If you set the same targeting parameters for each media source, the test includes the targeting abilities of the networks. When A/B testing, it\u2019s best to test a single variation each time. As a result, it's advisable to eliminate the differences in targeting abilities, when A/B testing other factors in the performance of networks. To achieve this, we recommend splitting an audience randomly and targeting both audiences with the same creative, on each tested network.

If one of your team members also has a Twitter Ads Account, this means that they have a different handle than yours and cannot connect their handle to AppsFlyer. This is because your handle is the one that is already connected with the AppsFlyer account. In order for their Twitter Ad Account to also appear in AppsFlyer, they need to give your handle access as account administrator to their Twitter Ads Account. Say your team member is Jenny and her handle is @jenny. Your handle is @nivi and is the handle that is connected to AppsFlyer. In order for her Twitter Ads Account to appear in the AppsFlyer account, she needs to give your handle access as account administrator to her Twitter Ads Account. Jenny needs to give access to Nivi to her Twitter Ads Account and not that other way around. When she does so, AppsFlyer looks at Nivi's handle, and sees all the ad accounts that it is associated with, Jenny's included. Jenny signs into ads.twitter.com She clicks on Account and then chooses Edit access to account Jenny then gives @nivi access to her Twitter Ads Account as or Account administrator Jenny logs into the AppsFlyer account and goes to Integrated Partners >> Twitter option At this stage, she can see her Twitter Ads Account also listed.

Organic search attribution Use organic search attribution to attribute existing users who re-engage with your app after an organic web search. To set up attribution: Give your app Android and iOS app developers the domain associated with your app. For Android, this means the domain with Android App Links configured to open the app for existing users. And for iOS, this means the domain with Universal Links is configured to open the app for existing users. Tell the developers what value to use for the media source (pid) parameter. For example: search_engine. Tell your developers to follow their Android App Links and iOS Universal Links instructions.Any installs from organic searches will display with the media source value you chose. For example: search_engine. Tip! Learn about search engine usage breakdown by geo Keyword data Organic search is a valuable traffic source for your apps. Organic users don't incur acquisition costs and are usually among the most engaged cohorts. With a few tweaks to your app page, it is possible to increase the amount of new organic installs. To optimize organic searches, you need to get organic keyword data for your app. iOS keywords If you work with Apple Search Ads, you can get detailed keyword data for your non-organic users attributed to Apple Search Ads. In iOS, organic keyword data is not available. Android keywords Google shares organic keyword data (on the Referrer URL) for users that do the following: Use Android devices Use Chrome browser Visit Google.com and perform a search Install an app from the Google results page Launch the app The SDK extracts the keywords when provided by Google in the &utm_term parameter of the referrer if it is part of the link to Google Play. The values where possible are contained in the following AppsFlyer raw data fields: http_referrer, gp_broadcast_referrer, keywords. Expect that less than 1% of organic Android users follow this funnel and have organic keyword data. In other scenarios, Google does not share organic keyword data. For example, users searching in Google Play don't have organic keyword data. Note This limitation is applied by Google to all external vendors, including all attribution vendors.

According to the announcement, apps targeting Android 13 (API 33) and above will have to declare a Google Play services normal permission in their manifest file in order to get access to the device\u2019s Advertising ID.

If the permission exists in both the app and the SDK, this works just fine\u2013there will be no collision.",
      "What you must know If you are using SDK V6.8.0 and have the AD_ID permission in your app\u2019s Manifest, you can optionally remove it from the manifest and let the SDK add it for you. If you are using SDK version older than V6.8.0, and your app is targeting Android 13 (API 33) and above, you should add the AD_ID permission to your app in order to allow the SDK to gain access to the Advertising ID. Kids Apps: According to Google\u2019s Policy, apps that target children must not transmit the Advertising ID. If you're building an app for kids and you are using SDK V6.8.0 and above, you must revoke the AD_ID permission. See developer instructions here."

    "answers": [
      "At a glance: Measure push notification campaigns on both iOS and Android. Overview AppsFlyer supports the measurement of push notification campaigns from all push providers, as well as campaigns implemented directly on top of Firebase Cloud Messaging or Apple Push Notification Services (APNS). There are 2 possible ways to implement the integration: By utilizing OneLink templates (recommended). By sending a JSON object with an af keyin the push notification's payload (legacy). The conversions display in the Overview dashboard, in the retargeting or unified views. How does it work? Once you've completed the steps in this article, your app will work as follows: You trigger a push notification that contains a OneLink template or an af key in its payload. The app user receives the push notification and clicks on it. The app loads and the AppsFlyer SDK starts. The SDK processes the payload of the push notification that opened the app. The SDK extracts and sends the attribution data to AppsFlyer. In the OneLink scenario, if the OneLink is configured to route the user to a specific location in the app, the deep link flow is triggered. Prerequisites Before continuing, make sure that your app has the AppsFlyer SDK integrated and can receive push notifications. Steps To set up push notification measurement, the following steps must be completed: Create a push notification that contains a custom data key with the OneLink template or an af key with a JSON object as its value. Configure the SDK to resolve the custom key (done by the app developer). Test the integration by triggering a push notification. View push notification campaigns performance in the dashboard.",

    "answers": [
      "At a glance: Agency fee rules are part of the AppsFlyer Xpend premium feature that enables advertisers to add the percentage fees agencies charge for traffic so they can see the total campaign cost. Overview Agency fee rules are defined by the advertiser (with AppsFlyer account admin privileges) in the rule builder using customized conditions that add fee percentages to the cost of agency campaigns for specific apps and/or media sources. Xpend uses the agency fee rule to calculate the total ad cost with the fee, based on the ad network API and attribution link cost. The calculation applies at every granularity level (campaign, adset, etc.). The results are displayed in your dashboards, reports, and Cost ETL; not in the agency or ad network dashboards and reports. Note: Cost ETL reports have additional fields for agency fees. Agency rules help advertisers: Understand the real cost of their ad campaigns Save time and manual effort to report on cost data Manage agency performance Accurately analyze historical cost data Procedures See the sections that follow for instructions on how view, add, edit, and delete rules. All procedures require AppsFlyer admin privileges.

    "title": "Why is my app still pending?",
    "answers": [
      "At a glance: Follow the status of apps pending publishing to app stores from the AppsFlyer dashboard. When you add your new app to the AppsFlyer dashboard, you first choose whether the app is pending or already in the market. Pending apps in AppsFlyer look the same as live apps. They have accessible dashboards and all attribution measurement works for them. The only difference is the logo of the app which displays with the AppsFlyer logo instead of the actual app logo. What's happening? AppsFlyer automatically checks the status of the apps several times a day. If the app is still not live in the store when AppsFlyer checks the status of the app, the app appears as pending in the dashboard. Once the app is finally submitted to iTunes or Google, it updates to active and the app logo changes to the app's original logo. The status of the app in the dashboard has no effect on data collection and measurement. If the app is live on Google Play or App Store and users install the app and interact with it, install and in-app event data displays in the dashboard just the same. Refreshing the app status For the status of the app to change to active, AppsFlyer checks its status in the store. If you are certain that the app is published in Google Play or iTunes, but it still appears as pending in the dashboard, an admin can manually check its status. Prerequisite: Available to account admin. To manually update the app status: In the dashboard, clickMy Apps in the top right-hand corner. Next to the pending app, clickRefresh Status.If the status of the app is unchanged, the app is still displayed as Pending. If it has been updated, the status is shown as Live and the logo is updated. Store country Some apps are only available in Google Play or iTunes for certain countries. It is important that the correct country is set for an app in order for AppsFlyer to be able to check and update its status. iOS When you add an iOS app to your AppsFlyer dashboard, you choose the Apple Store country in which the app is published. If the wrong country is chosen, AppsFlyer is unable to update the status of the app even if it is published. To change the Apple Store country: In your app's dashboard click on App Settingsin the left-hand menu Under App Store Country choose the correct country Scroll down and click Save Settings If the app still appears as pending, click Refresh Status. Android When you add an Android app to your AppsFlyer dashboard, there is no option to choose a Google Play country and it is set to US by default. If your app is not published in the US Google Play store, it is important that the correct store is set for the app in order for AppsFlyer to be able to check and update the status of the app. To change the Google Play country: In your app's dashboard click on App Settingsin the left-hand menu Under App Store Country choose the correct country Scroll down and click Save Settings If the app still appears as pending, click Refresh Status."

      "Related reading For a complete picture of working with rich in-app events, be sure to read these articles: Rich in-app events\u2014Overview Rich in-app events\u2014Event structure Events dashboard Introduction In-app events are a major tool for app owners to measure the quality of their users coming from different sources based on the actions they take after app installation. Events are also often used for performing CPA-based marketing campaigns. However, more than one person is often involved in the definition and integration of in-app events into the apps. While the marketer/product manager defines the event set content according to business needs, one or more mobile developers are generally required to implement the in-app events API in their apps. AppsFlyer's In-app event generator solves the challenges inherent in this essential collaboration between marketer and developer. By using the In-app event generator marketers can: Use a pre-defined recommended set of events and parameters for their vertical. Add or remove pre-defined or customized events/parameters, descriptions, triggers, and examples for reference. Send auto-generated code to their Android and iOS mobile developers \u2013 saving days of work, redundant communication, and potential errors. Re-use their work if they later update events, add new events, or add new apps. Using the In-app event generator Use the In-app event generator to create an event set for a new app, or to update an existing set. Creating a new event set To create a new event set: Go to the In-app event generator and enter the name of your app. Select a vertical or import the event set of a similar app that was previously exported to a JSON file. Add or remove events and parameters, according to your business needs. Click the </> Code button to view and copy the generated code for your developers: Java (native Android), Obj-C/Swift (native iOS), or C# (Unity). Click Download .zip to save the event set for future use or for collaborating with devs and colleagues. Updating an existing event set To update an existing event set: Go to the In-app event generator. Import an event set of your app that was previously exported to a JSON file. Add or remove events and parameters, according to your business needs. Click the </> Code button to view and copy the generated code for your developers: Java (native Android), Obj-C/Swift (native iOS), or C# (Unity). Click Download .zip to save the event set for future use or for collaborating with devs and colleagues. Adding events To add a new event to the event set: Click the + Event button. The new event appears at the bottom of the event set. Select a predefined event from the suggested list of events (recommended), or click Custom to define your own event name. Verify that the event name doesn't already exist in the event set. Enter the purpose of the event, describing the business scenario. Enter the trigger action for the event, explaining the time in the user journey that the event should be sent. This explanation is added as a comment in the generated code for quick reference by the developers. [Optional] Add one or more parameters to the event. Adding parameters To add a new parameter to the event set: Click the + Add parameter button for the relevant event. Select a predefined parameter from the suggested list of parameters (recommended). Otherwise, click Custom to define your own parameter name and press Enter. Type one or more typical parameter values for reference. To help your developers, type a general description, field type, or the corresponding source for the parameter value in your app. This appears as a comment for each event parameter in the generated code. Note: Predefined naming allows automatic mapping of events and parameters to partners and is the recommended method."

      "At a glance: Configure additional user identifiers for sending custom audiences to advertising partners. Background AppsFlyer Audiences automatically supports the following device identifiers for sending custom audiences to advertising partners: iOS: IDFA Android (Google Play): GAID Android (3rd-party app stores): OAID and IMEI Some advertising partners also support custom audience matching based on additional user identifiers. Audiences offers you the option to utilize these identifiers if you specifically configure them through the AppsFlyer SDK or S2S-mobile API.

      "Retargeting conversion data Retargeting includes two types of conversions, re-attribution or re-engagement. Tip Conversion data for retargeting doesn't always give a clear indication as to the type of conversion. See alternative conversion data sources. Re-attribution with SRNs When a user is re-attributed through an SRN, the conversion data payload doesn't indicate that this is a retargeting campaign. Since SRNs don't use attribution links, there is no way to set an is_retargeting=true parameter in the attribution link. For SRNs that do support retargeting, AppsFlyer determines whether the user should be re-attributed or not. What this means is that there is no way to determine, on the SDK level, if an install comes from a retargeting campaign. The only way is to set the campaign name such that it indicates a retargeting campaign. Note Setting the campaign name such that it indicates retargeting is not a foolproof method. See examples to learn more. Re-attribution with regular ad networks Attribution to ad networks relies on attribution links. Whether regular attribution links or OneLink, with retargeting the attribution link always has the is_retargeting=true parameter set in it.

      " Re-attribution with deferred deep linking Oftentimes, you want to deep link re-attributed users who, by definition of being re-attributed, don't have the app installed. For example, You set a campaign that aims to bring back users who uninstalled the app. The campaign promotes a product or service and you want to serve the users with content related to the product or service that you advertise. This is referred to as Deferred Deep Linking. Conversion data payload for Deferred Deep Linking comes from the onConversionDataSuccess method. Deferred deep linking with SRNs Deep Link parameters defined in SRNs campaigns are not available outside of the SRN. This includes the af_dp parameter, which holds the scheme path in the app. The only exception to this is when using Google App campaigns in Feeds. To implement deferred deep linking, additional logic must be applied for SRN campaigns. Use the data in onConversionSuccess response, such as campaign, adset, adgroup, to programmatically redirect your users.

Example The app is an eCommerce app that specializes in sportswear.

      " Deferred deep linking with attribution links There are three ways to deep link users: URI schemes When using URI Schemes, for both attribution links and OneLink, the attribution link and payload are as follows: Attribution Link http://app.appsflyer.com/com.appsflyer.nivisampleapp?pid=media_source_name &c=campaign_name&af_dp=superapp%3A%2F%2deeplink-activity OneLink // short OneLink https://dhba.onelink.me/2rAD/71ba577e //long OneLink https://dhba.onelink.me/2rAD?pid=media_source_name&c=campaign_name &is_retargeting=true&af_dp=superapp%3A%2F%2deeplink-activity Payload { \"af_deeplink\": true, \"campaign\": \"campaign_name\", \"media_source\": \"media_source_name\", \"retargeting_conversion_type\": \"none\", \"adset_id\": null, \"campaign_id\": null, \"orig_cost\": \"0.0\", \"click_time\": \"2018-12-30 23:59:09\", \"install_time\": \"2018-12-30 23:59:39.330\", \"agency\": null, \"cost_cents_USD\": \"0\", \"adset\": \"AD_SET_NAME\", \"ad_id\": \"AD_ID\", \"af_siteid\": null, \"http_referrer\": null, \"af_cpi\": null, \"af_sub5\": null, \"af_sub4\": null, \"af_sub1\": null, \"af_sub3\": null, \"af_sub2\": null, \"af_status\": \"Non-organic\", \"scheme\": \"superapp\", \"host\": \"deeplink_activity\" } af_deeplink: true- when this parameter appears and is set to true, look for the scheme and host fields scheme and host- these fields come from the af_dp parameter in the attribution link and indicate the scheme and activity to which the user should be deep linked iOS Universal links and Android app links These are the other two out of the three ways for performing deep linking. When using universal links or app links, the OneLink and payload are as follows: OneLink // short OneLink https://dhba.onelink.me/2rAD/71ba577e //long OneLink https://dhba.onelink.me/2rAD?pid=media_source_name&c=campaign_name &is_retargeting=true Payload { \"install_time\": \"2019-01-08 16:24:49.853\", \"cost_cents_USD\": \"0\", \"campaign\": \"campaign_name\", \"retargeting_conversion_type\": \"none\", \"is_first_launch\": true, \"click_time\": \"2019-01-08 16:24:14.322\", \"af_click_lookback\": \"7d\", \"orig_cost\": \"0.0\", \"af_status\": \"Non-organic\", \"iscache\": \"true\", \"shortlink\": \"71ba577e\", \"media_source\": \"media_source_name\", \"is_retargeting\": true } shortlink field - this is the field that indicates the specific OneLink that the user comes from. It helps the developer know how to proceed in terms of launching an activity and serving content. Other fields like campaign can also be used for this purpose. Important! The field shortlink does not appear in the payload when using the long OneLink. In both cases (short or long OneLink) we recommend adding a custom parameter that indicates the activity. For example &deep_link_activity=shoes_cateogry",
      " Note Using universal links and app links is only possible with OneLink.",
      " Re-engagement with SRNs Much like with Re-Attribution campaigns, when a user is re-engaged through an SRN, the conversion data doesn't indicate that this is a re-engagement campaign. You can set the campaign name such that it indicates a re-engagement campaign. Re-engagement with regular ad networks Here too, the conversion data payload doesn't indicate that the user comes from a re-engagement campaign. To overcome this limitation, you can set the campaign name to indicate a re-engagement. Re-engagement with deep linking A major part of Re-Engagement is to send the user to a specific activity. For example, if you advertise some product or sale. In such cases, you want to send the users who click the ad straight to the app activity for this product or sale. To do so, you use Deep Linking. The conversion data in Deep Linking is really important. It holds the information necessary for the developer to customize the user experience and send them to the correct activity. Re-engagement: deep linking with SRNs Conversion data is not available when a re-engaged user comes from an SRN. The developer needs to use the SRN methods to get it upon app launch.",
      "Re-engagement: deep linking with ad networks When a user is re-engaged and the app launches, the following conversion data is available in the onAppOpenAttribution method: For both iOS and Android, when using the short version of OneLink, the conversion data is a structured map of all the parameters on the link: Example: { af_dp: \"superapp://Deeplink\", pid: \"media_source_name\" c: \"campaign_name\", link: \"https://abcd.onelink.me/12ab/12ab34c\" is_retargeting: true } The app developer can use such parameters, like af_dp and campaign name, to send the user to a specific activity and serve the relevant content.",
      " Important! We recommend using the short version of OneLink. Click here to learn more. Another reason to use the short version of OneLink is the conversion data structure that the long version returns. When using the long version, the conversion data is a map with a single field called link that holds the entire long OneLink. { \"link\": \"https://abcd.onelink.me/12ab?pid=media_source&c=campaign_name&is_retargeting=true&af_dp=superapp%3A%2F%2FDeepLink\" } ",
      "Alternative conversion data sources Push API offers a detailed conversion payload that indicates re-attribution or re-engagement. Push API payloads include a field called re_targeting_conversion_type. This field indicates the type of conversion, either re-attribution or re-engagement. To learn more, see our Push API guide. Raw Data Reports also contain indicators for the type of conversion. In the raw data report for retargeting conversions, there is a column called Event Name. The value in this column is either re-engagement or re-attribution according to the type of conversion. Examples of mixed user acquisition and re-attribution A user installs your app and then uninstalls it. The act of installation puts the user in a re-attribution window. You set a user acquisition(not retargeting) campaign with Facebook. You also set the AppsFlyer integration with Facebook to allow retargeting.While still in the re-attribution window, the user sees the ad, clicks on it, and reinstalls the app. As far as AppsFlyer sees it, the user is a re-attributed user.This is due to two factors: The configuration with Facebook allows retargeting The user is in the re-attribution window In this case, the campaign name doesn't indicate re-attribution. Let's take the same example, only this time the user is outside the re-attribution window. In this case, the install is a new non-organic install. Let's look at another example. You set a retargeting campaign on Facebook. Some users come across the campaign and install the app. However, these users install the app for the first time. Such users are not considered re-attributed users. Instead, AppsFlyer considers them as users that come from a user acquisition campaign."

Therefore, if you repeatedly use the same device to test install attributions, nothing is recorded. Registering a test device prevents installs from being recorded as reinstalls. Methods for registering a test device Registering a test device includes selecting the device's operating system (Android, iOS, or Windows), and adding the device identifier. You can use one of the following methods to register: Download and install the My Device ID by AppsFlyer app: [admin only] Once you install the app on the test device, you can automatically register the device and share device ID details to your AppsFlyer account.

    "answers": [
      "At a glance: The AppsFlyer ad revenue SDK connector works with the Google Mobile Ads (GMA) SDK to report ad revenue with impression-level granularity. Note! This SDK connector is deprecated as of AppsFlyer SDK V6.9+, and is replaced by the generic ad revenue SDK connector. This version continues to work for earlier SDK versions, but will not be updated or changed. Impression-level ad revenue reporting by SDK Ad revenue reporting options Ad revenue is reported to AppsFlyer by AdMob by either aggregate granularity (via API) or impression-level granularity (via SDK). Impression-level data via SDK: Has better data freshness and earlier availability in AppsFlyer. Supports SKAN. This document details how to send impression-level ad revenue provided by AdMob in the app, to AppsFlyer. Reporting ad revenue using the GMA SDK SDK principles of operation The AppsFlyer ad revenue SDK connector for AdMob automatically collects impression revenue data provided by the GMA SDK. An ad revenue event, af_ad_revenue, is generated within the platform and the event is recorded with the revenue attributed to the original UA source. In the platform, a batch process extracts the attribution for each device, and revenue attribution is performed. Data display The af_ad_revenue event is used to identify ad revenue. This event is used throughout the platform, including the dashboard and data delivery tools. Considerations when migrating from API to SDK If you currently receive ad revenue by API from integrated partners that are mediated by AdMob, you can continue to do so. However, make sure that in the AppsFlyer platform you disable the integration with these partners when you implement the GMA monetization SDK. If you don't, ad revenue attribution may be duplicated. If you currently send ad revenue in-app events without revenue, for recording purposes only, you can continue sending them or disable them. In any event, they don't impact the allocation of impression-level revenue in the dashboard. Note: Some time can pass from the time you release the app version containing the ad revenue SDK to the app stores until your app users download the updated version. As such, leave the SDK module dormant and activate it after most of the users have updated the app. When you activate the module: Simultaneously disable the ad revenue integration of partners who mediate through AdMob In AppsFlyer, select impression level in the AdMob ad revenue tab.

      "At a glance: Use Google Play Auto Install (PAI) for your campaigns to attribute preloaded apps on Android devices. (Note that this attribution method differs from APK preinstall attribution.) What is a preload campaign? In preload campaigns, Original Device Manufacturers (OEMs) and mobile carriers (\"Preload Partners\"), preload apps on devices before they reach the user. This can be done by the OEM at the factory or by providers upon first device activation. Preload campaigns allow advertisers to reach a potentially large audience without running online campaigns. AppsFlyer supports the following preload campaign types: APK preload attribution relies on a dedicated APK installed by the OEM in the factory. Google Play Auto Install (PAI) is described in this article. PAI preload attribution flow When a new device is activated for the first time predefined apps are automatically installed in it from the cloud - according to rules set by the Preload Partner. When the user launches a preinstalled app for the first time, the AppsFlyer SDK queries the Google Play referrer API. AppsFlyer makes the attribution decision based on the data retrieved.

AppsFlyer uses the dev key to uniquely identify your account. The dev key is mandatory because it allows the SDK to securely send and retrieve data that belongs to your account. To retrieve your dev key: In AppsFlyer, go toConfiguration>App Settings. Copy your dev key, and send it to your mobile developer.

AppsFlyer supports attribution in the context of third-party app stores as follows: IMEI or Android ID: The SDK doesn't automatically collect the IMEI or Android ID. However, if there is a need to collect these identifiers (for example, for apps in the Chinese domestic market) your developer can implement one of the following collection types: Manual collection:The app passes the IMEI or Android ID to the SDK (using thesetImeiDataorsetAndroidIdDataAPI).

      " iOS only The following sections include important information about support for iOS 14+ devices.",
      "Configure App Tracking Transparency (ATT) support Background Starting with iOS 14.5, IDFA collection requires user consent. Practically, it means IDFA access is governed by the App Tracking Transparency (ATT) framework. On iOS 14+ devices, the SDK uses the ATT framework to obtain access to the device IDFA. For an introduction to ATT, see ATT principles. When attribution occurs using IDFA, it's important IDFA is sent on the first launch. For this reason, the SDK provides the waitForATTUserAuthorization utility. waitForATTUserAuthorization overview Important! Don't call waitForATTUserAuthorization if you don't intend to invoke the ATT prompt. waitForATTUserAuthorization enables you to configure how long the SDK should defer and wait for ATT status before sending data to the AppsFlyer servers. When a user launches the app, ATT status is notDetermined. During the waitForATTUserAuthorization timeout, the SDK queues the launch event and consecutive in-app events in-memory, similar to the way in which offline events are recorded: If the user consentsto the ATT prompt (IDFA collection): The SDK adds the IDFA to cached events. The SDK starts and sends cached events with IDFA (without waiting for the timeout to end). If the user declines the ATT prompt: The SDK starts and sends cached events without IDFA (without waiting for the timeout to end). If the timeout ends and ATT status remains notDetermined: The SDK starts and sends cached events without IDFA. Considerations Calling requestTrackingAuthorization without setting waitForATTUserAuthorization will result in launches and events being sent without IDFA for iOS 14+ devices. If the user moves the app to the background during the timeout: The timer pauses until the app returns to the foreground. Events are cached in-memory. If the user shuts down the app, it is killed during the timeout: The timer is restarted on the next app launch. Cached events are lost.",
      " Customize ATT consent dialog You can customize the ATT prompt. A message that clearly states the purpose of the request could help increase the opt-in rates for users. Consider the following when creating your message: Use wording that best explains to your users why the app is asking for user consent. Inform users about how their data will be used. Learn more about user privacy and data use. Once your message is complete, provide your developer with the text and implementation instructions. See some external examples of ATT prompts.",
      " Support for SKAN attribution",
      "Note To fully support SKAN attribution, upgrade to iOS SDK V6.2.3+. SKAN is a class used by iOS to validate advertiser-driven app installations. The app install validation process involves the source app and the advertised app. A source app is an app that participates in ad campaigns by displaying ads from an ad network. Configuring your app to display ads is not within the scope of the AppsFlyer SDK. To configure, follow the Apple instructions. For the advertised app (the app with the AppsFlyer SDK), the AppsFlyerSKAN solution uses SKAN to provide the attribution postback while AppsFlyer collects, translates, and aggregates the data while maintaining user privacy. When the app is launched for the first time, the AppsFlyer platform uses the configuration set by the marketer to instruct the SDK how to set the SKAN conversion value. To use the SKAN solution: The marketer needs to configure SKAN measurement in AppsFlyer. The developer does not have to perform any tasks. The AppsFlyer SDK automatically calls the necessary SKAN APIs. Make sure to disable SKAN calls in other SDKs if you rely on AppsFlyer for SKAN attribution. There is no other action or registration process required by either the developer or the marketer in the App Store. To disable SKAN attribution, instruct your developer to disable it in the SDK.",
      "Recording in-app events In-app events (IAE) provide insight into what is happening in your app. Recording in-app events helps you measure KPIs like Return on Investment (ROI) and Lifetime Value (LTV). We recommend taking the time to define the events that you want to record. Once you determine the in-app events you want to measure, send the event names and parameters to your developer, and include a link to the implementation instructions. To learn more about in-app events, see our Rich in-app events guide. All platforms Record revenue You can send revenue with any in-app event.

      "Tip We recommend the following: Use Push API to retrieve attribution data and send it to your servers for further processing. This method waits for the data to become available, and therefore is highly accurate and close to real-time. GCD returns data in real-time, but may be inaccurate when final attribution decisions are determined after more than 5 seconds. Use Pull API to periodically (for example, daily) supplement real-time attribution data, and to compensate for any communication errors that might occur. Testing your SDK integration Once the SDK integration is complete, you can go to the AppsFlyer dashboard, and from the SDK Integration Tests page, test organic and non-organic installs, in-app events, and deep linking (retargeting). This ensures that installs and in-app events are recorded and attributed correctly. If you need your developer to test the SDK integration, add the developer as a userin your account, so they can access the dashboard.

The integration utilizes Iterable\u2019s support for Universal Links on top of branded click recording domains. Introduction ESPs (Email Service Providers) can be excellent sources for segmented user traffic. One of the problems with ESPs is recording clicks while keeping deep linking functionality intact. ESPs wrap deep linking URLs with their own ESP's click recording domain. This procedure sometimes breaks the iOS Universal Links process. With Iterable, which supports Universal Links on top of their click recording domain, deep linking and click recording can still be performed. Prerequisites iOS Android",

No special actions are required on Iterable side to support deep linking in Android. Setting up Iterable Step 1: Setting up link branding in Iterable Create a dedicated click recording domain and set a subdomain (for example, click.example.com).This can be done by purchasing a designated domain or using your own domain. For more information on setting a click recording domain with Iterable, see here. Step 2: Uploading your SSL certificate to Iterable Your click recording domain must include your domain\u2019s SSL certificate. The SSL certificate should be installed in your Iterable account. Instructions on installing your SSL certificates can be foundhere. Step 2: Give Iterable an AASA (iOS) and an Asset Links file (Android) AASA for iOS For Iterable to support iOS Universal Links, they need an AASA file. See the following instructions. When you set up OneLink with Universal Links, you already have an AASA associated with the OneLink. To obtain the AASA: Go to OneLink templates and find a OneLink that is configured with Universal Links. Add /.well-known/apple-app-site-associationto the end of the OneLink URL. Paste the OneLink in the browser address bar and hit enter. For example:<OneLinkSubdomain>.onelink.me/.well-known/apple-app-site-association. When you do so, the AASA file is downloaded to your computer. You can open it using any simple text editor. Define link re-write rules. For more information see here. Send this AASA file to Iterable.

    "answers": [
      "At a glance: Cross-reference your in-house data with AppsFlyer attribution data by the Customer User ID (CUID) field. Implementing the CUID The Customer User ID (CUID) field is a unique user identifier set by app and website owners. CUID is reported by you to AppsFlyer using AppsFlyer APIs or SDKs. AppsFlyer populates the CUID field in raw data reports accordingly. Use the CUID to cross-reference AppsFlyer attribution data with your other data using the CUID as a key. Example: A user with two devices has the same CUID (\"1234567\"). Each time they perform an event on a device, it is recorded along with the CUID. This enables the advertiser to aggregate both devices' raw data into a holistic view of the user. CUID is used by AppsFlyer Audiences and People-Based Attribution solutions for improved accuracy and targeting. CUID design and privacy AppsFlyer values and respects the privacy of you and your users. We don't permit the collection or transfer of directly identifiable personal information to the AppsFlyer platform. To ensure the privacy of your users, design the CUID without information directly identifying the user. For example, it should not contain the user's email address, name, telephone number, social security number, etc. Related reading:Google best practices to avoid sending PII Delay SDK start until CUID is set You can delay the SDK start until the CUID is set. In addition to your business logic, consider the following before doing so: Pros: Attribution data is always associated with a CUID. Use the CUID to associate attribution data with other data you have in your systems. This allows a more sophisticated use and processing of the data that you get from AppsFlyer.",
      "Cons: Actions and events that users perform, including purchases and subscriptions, aren't recorded in AppsFlyer until CUID is set. This can lead to discrepancies, and can affect fraud detection (which can't necessarily be identified before SDK initialization).",
      "Note: If the SDK start is delayed until there's a CUID, and no CUID gets set, the SDK doesn't report any data (including an install). Setting the CUID Android SDK developer instructions To set your Customer User ID: public void setCustomerUserId(String id); Usage example: AppsFlyerLib.getInstance().setCustomerUserId(\"myId\"); We recommend setting the Customer User ID early in the app's flow, as it is only associated with events reported after its setup: If setCustomerUserId is called before calling start, the Customer User ID appears in the raw data reports for installs and for events. If it is set after, the Customer User ID is only associated with events that are recorded after setting the Customer User ID. Getting Customer User ID To avoid setting the Customer User ID value again beyond the first launch, and to reduce calls to your server to get the Customer User ID, you can check if its value is empty or not by using: AppsFlyerProperties.getInstance().getString(AppsFlyerProperties.APP_USER_ID) Delay SDK init for customerUserID You can delay the SDK Initialization until the customerUserID is set. To indicate that the SDK should delay initialization for the Customer User ID call: AppsFlyerLib.getInstance().waitForCustomerUserId(true); immediately before the init() method. The rest of the SDK initialization should remain unchanged. Once the customerUserID has been provided, call AppsFlyerLib.getInstance().setCustomerIdAndLogSession(\"customer_id\", this); to provide the SDK with the relevant Customer User ID and start the SDK.

Implement the following code: Objective-C Swift - (void)applicationDidBecomeActive:(UIApplication *)application { NSString *customUserId = [[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults] stringForKey:@\"customerUserId\"]; // Your custom logic of retrieving CUID if (customUserId != nil && ![customUserId isEqual: @\"\"]) { [AppsFlyerLib shared].customerUserID = customUserId; // Set CUID in AppsFlyer SDK for this session [[AppsFlyerLib shared] start]; // Start } } func applicationDidBecomeActive(_ application: UIApplication) { let customUserId = UserDefaults.standard.string(forKey: \"customUserId\") // your logic to retrieve CUID if(customUserId != nil && customUserId != \"\"){ AppsFlyerLib.shared().customerUserID = customUserId // Set CUID in AppsFlyer SDK for this session AppsFlyerLib.shared().start() // Start } }",
      " People-Based Attribution AppsFlyer People-Based Attribution (PBA) gives you a broad perspective on the impact of web and mobile campaigns, as well as the ability to analyze your efforts to switch web users to your mobile app and vice versa. You must set the same CUID in both mobile and web environments to enable cross-platform insights and analytics."

AppsFlyer preload referrer attribution Preload referrer attribution gives marketers an accurate and privacy-preserving mechanism to measure the performance of preload campaigns. User privacy is assured because attribution is performed using referrer matching. The referrer is generated independently of the device and user identifiers. This method provides marketers with deterministic attribution results and simultaneously ensures that user privacy is maintained. The solution provides: Transparent support for app updates and app redownloads. Visibility into the device first activation with the preloaded apps including the time and geo (country). For example, marketers are able to tell how many devices got activated with an app preloaded in certain geo during a certain time period. AppsFlyer gives the highest priority to preload attribution.

      "At a glance: Collect the Android OAID to attribute installs from third-party Android app stores. About OAID The Open Anonymous Device Identifier (OAID) is a user-resettable unique identifier for Android devices. It was introduced by the Mobile Security Alliance (MSA), China Information and Communication Research Institute, and device manufacturers, as a privacy-preserving alternative to non-resettable device identifiers like IMEI. The OAID is usually used for ad measurement and install attribution on devices where Google Play Services aren't available (meaning where Google Advertising ID does not exist). The OAID is readable on all devices using an SDK provided by the MSA, or on Hauwei devices using the Huawei Mobile Service (HMS) Core SDK. Integration The integration of OAID consists of 3 steps: Integrating an SDK to generate and provide the OAID (either the MSA SDK or Huawei HMS SDK). Integrating the AppsFlyer OAID plugin module. Integrating the AppsFlyer SDK. Note: For apps that are intended to be used in China, the MSA SDK must be used. For apps that are intended to be used globally on Huawei devices, the Huawei HMS library should be used.",

These campaigns usually have a good conversion rate and generate significant ROAS. However, many retargeting campaigns underperform as they don't filter out active users. To increase the incremental lift of retargeting campaigns, implement minimum inactivity time to filter out active users. By setting a minimum inactivity time, Advertisers don't attribute active users. For example, if the minimum inactivity limit is three days, then users active in the previous 0-3 days aren't attributed. Users inactive for four or more days are attributed. The inactivity period applied to both re-attribution and re-engagement scenarios. In the case of re-attribution, the last activity is the last session before performing the uninstall.

      "At a glance: Set up the data sources you upload to the Data Clean Room (DCR) for enrichment with attribution/in-app event data and DCR report creation. Introduction Many DCR reports are designed to match attribution data/in-app event data with data from your custom sources. This article contains everything you need to know about setting up custom sources for use with the DCR, including how to: Format the source files you upload and the data they contain Create the source within the DCR Name the source Specify the location to which the source files are uploaded Define the structure of the source (labeling fields as metrics, dimensions, and identifiers) Save the source",
      "Upload source files on a regular basis to trigger report processing Work with existing sources Source format File format Uploaded data source files must meet these name, file format, and location requirements: Must comply with DCR naming requirements CSV or GZIP format. The file underlying GZIP compression must be a CSV file. Number of data source files per data folder: CSV: Maximum of 1 GZIP: Maximum of 1 single-part file. Multi-part GZIP files are supported when named as follows: filename_part01.gzip, filename_part02.gzip, etc.",

      "Creating a source The process of creating a source consists of all the steps described below. They are separated into tabs simply for ease of reading. Follow these steps to create a source: #1: Name the source Go to the Sources tab of the Data Clean Room. Click the + New source button.The New source page opens. Enter the name of the source in the upper-left corner. This can be any unique name that will help you identify the source in the DCR platform. It does not need to match the file name. Important! Ensure that the source name is different from all other sources in your account or you will not be able to save the source. Source name requirements: Length: 2-80 characters Valid characters: letters (A-Z, a-z) numbers (0-9), cannot be the first character of a name;",
      "Invalid characters: spaces all other symbols or special characters",
      " #2: Specify the source location The source location consists of a cloud storage bucket (known as a connector) and the underlying folder path from which the DCR reads the source file each time it is updated. Once you have specified the connector, AppsFlyer can automatically generate the required folders as part of the source creation process. Allowing AppsFlyer to generate the folders makes the process easy. However, you can choose to manually create them instead, according to the instructions detailed here. If AppsFlyer generates the folders, the only additional information required is the name you want to give the source folder. (This is the top-level folder in which you update the source each time your want to use it for running a new report version.) You can also indicate whether you want the source folder to be created underneath a parent folder \u2013 often named input. To specify the source location: Select the connector in which the source folder will be (or has been) created. If there are no connectors defined in your account, the New connector dialog will open, prompting you to create one. If you have existing connectors but want to use a new one, click the + New connector link. Enter the source folder name. By default, the displayed source folder name: Is based on the name you gave the source. You can change the folder name to meet your needs, so long as it complies with the DCR naming requirements. Indicates that it will be generated within a parent folder named input. This folder serves as the parent folder for all sources you upload to the DCR. The input folder is not required, and you can remove it or name it something different, so long as it complies with the DCR naming requirements. Although this folder is not required, having an input folder (or an equivalent folder of a different name) is considered best practice. It is even more highly recommended when you are using the same connector both for uploading data files (input) and receiving reports (output).",
      " Important! If you manually created the folder path, make sure the connector and path you enter in the Source location section match the path you manually created.",
      " #3: Define the source structure For all sources that you upload to the DCR for processing, AppsFlyer needs to know how each data field should be used in order to create reports. Defining the source structure consists of loading a prototype source file and categorizing each field (column) as one of the following types: Identifier:Field that identifies a unique app user (examples might include CUID, AppsFlyer ID, etc.) The primary purpose of identifiers in the context of the DCR is to join data sources so that corresponding user-level data can be matched.",
      "Dimension:An attribute by which you categorize app users (examples might include geo, install date, campaign, etc.) Metric: Numeric data you have collected with respect to an app user (examples might include revenue, number of app opens, LTV, etc.) A data field identified as a metric can contain only numeric values.",

      " Uploading source files to trigger report processing Each time you want AppsFlyer to process a data source file and run a report based on it, you upload a new version of the file to the source folder, within a series of nested subfolders indicating the date and version number (plus one extra subfolder to let AppsFlyer know where the data is). AppsFlyer continually scans for new versions of source files for the current date and 3 days prior. A new version of a report is triggered each time a new version of the source files are found (including _SUCCESS files, as further detailed below). Nested subfolders for each date and version The structure of nested subfolders is as follows: Within the source folder --> 1 subfolder for each date (\"date folder\") Format: dt=yyyy-mm-dd/ Example: dt=2022-12-15/",
      "Within each date folder --> 1 subfolder for each version on that date (\"version folder\") Format: v=n/ Example: v=1/ Note: The version folder is required even if you only upload the file one time per day.

      "_SUCCESS files Once the upload of a source file to the data folder is complete, an empty file named _SUCCESS should be uploaded to the version folder. This alerts AppsFlyer that a new file is available to be processed. In most cases, you use an API script to automatically generate and upload this file. Important! The _SUCCESS file must be uploaded to the version folder, outside the data folder. The filename for the _SUCCESS file: Must be in ALL CAPS Must be preceded by an underscore (_) Should not have a file extension For multi-part GZIP files: Only one _SUCCESS file should be uploaded for all file parts.

For DV360 (DBM): The Agency must configure their own Floodlights (src, cat, type, token). For the agency to do so, the advertiser must activate DV360 in their own account. The advertiser should only activate the integration. They don't need to configure any floodlight parameters.",
      "Support for retargeting and reengagement To enable support for retargeting and reengagement, the advertiser needs to enable retargeting when they activate the GMP in their account. The advertiser only needs to enable retargeting. They don't need to configure any floodlight parameters. In-app event mapping Agencies can have their own in-app event mapping with GMP, even if the advertiser client also has its own mapping. More details here. How many agencies can work on GMP per app? AppsFlyer supports up to ten different configurations per app including the advertiser's own configuration (that is, the advertiser's configuration and nine additional agency configurations). Once the maximum number of configurations is reached, an existing configuration must be deleted before adding a new configuration. Agency configuration vs. advertiser configuration Agencies and Advertisers can both promote the same apps using GMP. If you choose to run campaigns separately from the agency please take the following into consideration: Distinct floodlight parameters Floodlight parameters should not be shared between agencies and advertisers. If the advertiser and agency configure the integration with GMP using the sameFloodlight parameters, the advertiser cannot view any data in their dashboard. It is crucial that each party use different Floodlight parameters."

The backend logic keeps track of subscriptions (new and renewed) and sends subscription events to AppsFlyer as necessary. Sending server-to-server events to AppsFlyer for subscription notifications AppsFlyer by default doesn't receive notifications of renewal or subscription events from the app stores. This section discusseshow to set up a connection to the respective app store and pass subscription information to AppsFlyer as a server-to-server event. Android iOS Managing subscriptions on Android can be done on the App and Server levels. On the App level, communication is done through Google Play Billing Library. On the Server level while it is done through Google Play Developer API. The recommended way formanaging subscriptions is through Google Play Developer API. This is the way that is discussed in this article. Step 1:Set up the server endpoint to receive subscription-related notifications Create a server endpoint that receives subscription-related notifications from Google Cloud. Then,enable real-time developer notifications: Determine a URL endpoint on your server to use for subscription status updates. For example, https://myserver/subscription-notifications. Set up Cloud Pub/Sub in your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project. Enable real-time developer notifications for your Android app. Step 2: Handle real-time subscription notifications Once you set up a server endpoint to receive notifications, write the logic to handle these notifications. By default, Google sends notifications through Pub/Sub with subscriptionId and purchaseToken. The notification message doesn't contain any relevant information about the actual subscription. You need to take the purchase token and send a request to the Google Play Developer API to purchases.subscriptions. The subscription notification contains the following: { \t\"version\": string, \t\"packageName\": string, \t\"eventTimeMillis\": 1578509686, \t\"subscriptionNotification\": SubscriptionNotification, \t\"testNotification\": AppsFlyerTest } In the subscription notification, there's an object called SubscriptionNotification. It contains the following. { \t\"version\": 1.0, \t\"notificationType\": 4, \t\"purchaseToken\": 0f43308f-bf3f-4fa1-8aef-d515c941334b, \t\"subscriptionId\": 123456789 } purchaseToken is the token that you send to Google Play Developer API to purchases.subscriptionsget data about the subscription. The subscriptionId is the value you store into your database and associate it with the AppsFlyer ID. Step 3: Associate subscription with Appsflyer ID and GAID in your database Once you get the data about the subscription, you need to set up a link between the subscription ID and the AppsFlyer ID and GAID. The AppsFlyer ID is mandatory for sending server-to-server events to AppsFlyer. We strongly recommend including the GAID when sending a server-to-server event. Including it allows AppsFlyer to send event postbacks to SRNs (self-reporting networks). It also opens for you the option to use AppsFlyer Audiences. You can get the AppsFlyer ID and GAID in one of the following ways: SDK Raw data Push API Pull API The complete Android subscription attribution flow See the following flowchart for the complete subscription attribution flow: Getting notified about a subscription status change. Associating a subscription with AppsFlyer ID and GAID. Sending a subscription-related event to AppsFlyer. Apple calls its service Server-to-Server notifications. This service is designed specifically for auto-renewable subscriptions. The App Store sends notifications of real-time changes in a subscription's status. You can use these notifications and their data to send subscription-related events to AppsFlyer. Step 1: Set up the server endpoint to receive subscription-related notifications Set up a server endpoint that receives post requests. Configure the endpoint as follows: Support App Transport Security (ATS) on your server. The App Store must establish a secure network connection with your server by using ATS protocols before sending notifications. For more information, see preventing insecure network connections. Determine a URL endpoint on your server to use for subscription status updates. For example, https://myserver/subscription-notifications. Configure the subscription status URL for your app in App Store Connect. For guidance, see Enable status notifications for auto-renewable subscriptions. Step 2: Connect the server endpoint to your app: Once the endpoint is configured, input the server URL in the Subscription Status URL field in App Store Connect: Step 3: Receive the notification and associate it with AppsFlyer IDs and IDFA in your database Now you are ready to receive notifications from Apple about subscriptions. See the following sample notification: { \"latest_receipt\": \"ewoXXXXX\", \"latest_receipt_info\": { \"original_purchase_date_pst\": \"2019-07-29 21:13:18 America/Los_Angeles\", \"quantity\": \"1\", \"unique_vendor_identifier\": \"XXX\", \"original_purchase_date_ms\": \"1564459998000\", \"expires_date_formatted\": \"2019-08-06 04:13:17 Etc/GMT\", \"is_in_intro_offer_period\": \"false\", \"purchase_date_ms\": \"1564459997000\", \"expires_date_formatted_pst\": \"2019-08-05 21:13:17 America/Los_Angeles\", \"is_trial_period\": \"true\", \"item_id\": \"1452171111\", \"unique_identifier\": \"00000\", \"original_transaction_id\": \"0000000\", \"expires_date\": \"00000000\", \"app_item_id\": \"0000000\", \"transaction_id\": \"00000000\", \"bvrs\": \"00000\", \"web_order_line_item_id\": \"00000000\", \"version_external_identifier\": \"000000\", \"bid\": \"com.XXX\", \"product_id\": \"XXXXX\", \"purchase_date\": \"2019-07-30 04:13:17 Etc/GMT\", \"purchase_date_pst\": \"2019-07-29 21:13:17 America/Los_Angeles\", \"original_purchase_date\": \"2019-07-30 04:13:18 Etc/GMT\" }, \"environment\": \"PROD\", \"auto_renew_status\": \"true\", \"password\": \"*****\", \"auto_renew_product_id\": \"com.XXXX\", \"notification_type\": \"INITIAL_BUY\" } Important! The data from Apple's Status Update Notification doesn't contain the subscription price. You should implement backend logic to match the notification from Apple with the correct subscription price. You use this data to send subscription-related events to AppsFlyer. To do so, you need to associate a subscription with an AppsFlyer ID and IDFA. We strongly recommend including the IDFA when sending a server-to-server event. Including it allows AppsFlyer to send event postbacks to SRNs (self-reporting networks). It also opens for you the option to use AppsFlyer Audiences. You can get the AppsFlyer ID and IDFA in one of the following ways: SDK Raw data Push API Pull API The complete iOS subscription attribution flow See the following flowchart for the complete subscription attribution flow: Getting notified about a subscription status change. Associating a subscription with AppsFlyer ID and IDFA. Sending a subscription-related event to AppsFlyer. Sending the event to AppsFlyer At this point, you have knowledge of a subscription status change (purchase, renewal, cancellation) and have associated it with an AppsFlyer ID. Now, make sure the following takes place: Your server gathers the necessary data for the event. Such data should include the following: revenue, subscription type, subscription ID (item_id in the data from Apple), AppsFlyer ID, time of renewal. Recommended mapping (see the code snippet below): af_revenue: revenue af_content_type: subscription type af_content_id:subscription ID (item_id in the data from Apple) renewal: true/false (based on subscription status change) eventTime: the time the notification reaches your server Based on the type of event (purchase, renewal, cancellation), the server sends the event to AppsFlyer as a subscription event with all related data. Formatting and sending the event Subscription event request example: HTTP POST https://api2.appsflyer.com/inappevent/<APP_ID> HTTP/1.1 headers: { authentication: '<YOUR_DEV_KEY>', Host: 'api2.appsflyer.com', Accept: 'application/json', 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } body: { \"appsflyer_id\":\"<APPS_FLYER_ID>\", \"customer_user_id\":\"123456\", \"eventName\":\"af_subscribe\", \"eventValue\":\"{\\\"af_revenue\\\":\\\"200\\\",\\\"af_content_id\\\":\\\"092\\\", \\\"af_content_type\\\": \\\"123\\\", \\\"renewal\\\":\\\"true\\\"}\", \"eventCurrency\":\"USD\", \"ip\":\"1.0.0.0\", \"eventTime\":\"2018-07-09 4:17:00.000\", \"af_events_api\":\"true\" } To learn how to format and send the event to AppsFlyer, see sending server-to-server events."

      "At a glance: Set up recording for different Google Ads accounts so traffic gets attributed correctly. Introduction Google Ads traffic often comes from various accounts, such as agencies specializing in Google Ads or even different local teams within the app owner\u2019s organization. It is important to understand how to set up recordings for different Google Ads accounts so that attribution goes to the correct parties. This article covers these cases, from measuring agencies to using MCCs and also MCCs of MCCs. Note The following applies onlyto clients using the Google Ads new API.

When linking agency accounts with existing apps on AppsFlyer\u2019s dashboard, you can define up to 10 customer IDs. MCC - A Google Ads manager account (MCC, formerly called My Clients Center) is a Google Ads tool for handling multiple Google Ads accounts.With an MCC account, you can link several accounts so you can view them in a single location (Read more). Setting up Google Ads recording AppsFlyer can record a single link ID per app. When multiple accounts handle the same app, they should all use the same link ID. Thisshould be configured on AppsFlyer\u2019s dashboard for attribution purposes. Sharing Google link ID with another account App owners having a single Google Ads account, or that plan on working with agencies running Google Ads traffic should use the following method. The app owner can share any link ID with any other account, identified by its customer ID, as the capture below shows. Here are some more details about sharing the link ID with an agency. Important If MCC is the Recording Manager for subaccounts then there is no need to share the Link ID from the MCC to the subaccounts. However, if a subaccount, under the MCC is its own recording manager, then the MCC must share the Link ID with the subaccount Recording Manager. Importing Conversions: If MCC is the Recording Manager then the MCC is responsible for importing conversions for the subaccounts controlled by it.

      " Tip AppsFlyer recommends sharing the Link ID from the advertiser\u2019s main account to the other accounts, rather than directly generating link IDs in those accounts. This is the fastest option, and also enables easy detachment between the advertiser and the agencies once the mutual work is completed. MCC Agencies or large advertisers, who manage multiple Google Ads accounts, often use an MCC (My Client Center), which enables viewing all their accounts in a single location. During the MCC setup, it is possible to configure whether the MCC or the Subaccounts manage the conversions. This setup can be modified afterward if needed. MCC of MCCs Big advertisers working with multiple agencies may use an MCC of MCCs account. Similar to the standard MCC account. It is recommended that the highest level MCC of MCCs or Advertiser is the one to generate the link ID. The correct setup for this structure requires the subaccounts to select the correct level of MCC (most likely, the highest level of MCC) as the Recording Manager. If this is the setup used, then the Link ID does not need to be shared with subaccounts and the import conversions at the highest level are sufficient. Tip For additional information about MCCs and hierarchies of accounts, see the links below: Linking accounts to your account manager Viewing hierarchy for your manager account Working with managed accounts For questions regarding account structures and recommendations, consult with your Google representative. Opening a Google Ads campaign An MCC can\u2019t open a Google Ads campaign directly. Rather, this must be done via a standard Google Ads subaccount. There are two options for conversion recording: MCC manages subaccount recordingCommon for when there are different teams within the same company, for example, Google Ads account per geo region in the same company.The MCC holds the recording configuration (Recording Manager) for all its subaccounts. Any changes in the recording configuration are done only at the MCC level and all subaccounts inherit it automatically.The MCC also needs to import the conversions, which is done once and covers all subaccounts, and also get the link IDs shared for the subaccounts. Subaccounts manage ownrecordingCommon for accounts that are not connected except for a single entity serving them, for example, one agency serving different advertiser client accounts.Importing the conversions, in this case, needs to be done with every subaccount separately. AppsFlyer records a single link ID per app, so for mobile recording, the MCC or advertiser must share the link ID with the subaccounts. The conversions on Google Ads can be imported ONLY after the first instance of any conversion occurs, whether install or in-app event."

    "title": "In-app events for hybrid apps",
    "answers": [
      "At a glance: Record in-app events of users who have your app installed, but perform an event on your mobile website, and not the app. Introduction In-app events that occur within the app are reported using the SDK. What about events that occur outside the app? There are a few scenarios in which events occur outside the app context: Events that take place on your website: Implement People-Based Attribution (PBA)to get aunified view of customer journeys across channels, platforms including the website, and devices. This provides you with Web-to-App, Conversion paths analysis, and raw-data. Backend servers: Events occur independently of user action on either the website or app. For example, automatic subscription renewal Hybrid: The event takes place on your mobile website on a device having the app as described in this article.In-app events are recorded by calling the AppsFlyer SDK API using Javascript. This guide regards the hybrid scenario. Learn how to bridge the gap between the HTML view and native views, enabling you to record events in the HTML view and send them to the app. Example You have a hybrid app that offers subscriptions. You implement the subscription form in a web view which actually loads from your website. You can record the subscription in-app event in the web view and send data related to it, like subscription type or price, to the native code. The native code collects the data and uses the AppsFlyer SDK to send the subscription in-app event. Recording in-app events in hybrid apps In this guide we provide two methods for recording in-app events in hybrid apps: [Recommended] JavaScript interface: Uses the native JavaScript interface in order to establish communication between the HTML or Web View and the native code.This way you can send in-app event-related data from the web view to the native code. Once the native code obtains the data, it sends it to AppsFlyer using the SDK. URL loading: In this method, the native code listens to URL loading events.You can set the native code to listen to loading events of specific URLs and extract data from the URL parameters. The data is then passed to the SDK. Javascript interface Both Android and iOS have native Javascript interfaces that allow web views to call native code. Android: JavascriptInterface iOS: JavaScriptCore Advantages of using the native JavaScript interface over URL loading: It doesn't require implementing logic that listens to URL loading. Native interfaces are preferable to other implementations. There is no need to parse parameters from the URL. There is less code and therefore less maintenance required. The implementation consists of the following steps: HTML code for webview or web page Native code implementation for webview",
      "Android HTML code for Android Add the following HTML code to the web view or web page: <h1>Recording Event From Web View</h1> <div id=\"main\"> <button id=\"recordEvent\" onclick=\"recordEvent()\"> Record Event </button> </div> <script type=\"text/javascript\"> function recordEvent(){ var eventName = \"af_purchase\" var eventParams = \"{\\\"af_revenue\\\":\\\"6.72\\\", \\\"af_content_type\\\": \\\"wallets\\\", \\\"af_content_id\\\": \\\"15854\\\"}\"; app.recordEvent(eventName, eventParams) } </script> When passing event value, keep the following in mind: Make sure to pass the event value as a stringified JSON. \"{\\\"af_revenue\\\":\\\"6.72\\\", \\\"af_content_type\\\": \\\"wallets\\\", \\\"af_content_id\\\": \\\"15854\\\"}\" To avoid any possible problems AppsFlyer recommends using only lower-case alpha-numeric characters (a-z and 0-9) for your in-app event names. WebActivity class Create a web activity class with the following code: public class WebActivity extends AppCompatActivity { WebView web; @Override public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) { super.onCreate(savedInstanceState); setContentView(R.layout.activity_web); web = (WebView) findViewById(R.id.webView); web.getSettings().setJavaScriptEnabled(true); web.addJavascriptInterface(new MainJsInterface(getApplicationContext()), \"app\"); web.loadUrl(\"https://yourwebsite.com\"); } } The code above creates an object called app that acts as the bridge between the web view and the native code. JavaScript interface class Create a MainJsInterface class to implement recordEvent() as JavascriptInterface public class MainJsInterface { Context mContext; MainJsInterface(Context c) { mContext = c; } @JavascriptInterface public void recordEvent(String name, String json){ Map<String, Object> params = null; if(json!=null) { try { JSONObject jsonObject = new JSONObject(json); params = new HashMap<>(); Iterator keys = jsonObject.keys(); while (keys.hasNext()) { String key = keys.next(); Object value = jsonObject.opt(key); params.put(key, value); } } catch (JSONException e) { e.printStackTrace(); } } AppsFlyerLib.getInstance().logEvent(this.mContext, name, params); } } The code above declares a recordEvent method that can be called in the web view using Javascript. In the HTML code, you can see that the method is called using app.recordEvent(eventName, eventParams). Recall that we set app to act as the bridge between the web view and native code. This is why app can call the recordEvent method that we define in MainJsInterface class.",
      "iOS HTML code for iOS Add the following HTML code to the web view or web page: <body> <h1>Recroding Event From Web View</h1> <div id=\"main\"> <button id=\"recordEvent\" onclick=\"recordEvent()\"> Record Event </button> </div> <script type=\"text/javascript\"> function recordEvent(){ var eventName = \"af_purchase\" var eventParams = \"{\\\"af_revenue\\\":\\\"6.72\\\", \\\"af_content_type\\\": \\\"wallets\\\", \\\"af_content_id\\\": \\\"15854\\\"}\"; webkit.messageHandlers.event.postMessage(eventName + \"+\" + eventParams); } </script> </body> The code above sets a function to be triggered when a button is clicked. The function sets the eventName and eventParams variables and passes them to the native code using webkit.messageHandlers. When passing event value, keep the following in mind: Make sure to pass the event value as a stringified JSON. \"{\\\"af_revenue\\\":\\\"6.72\\\", \\\"af_content_type\\\": \\\"wallets\\\", \\\"af_content_id\\\": \\\"15854\\\"}\" To avoid any possible problems AppsFlyer recommends using only lower-case alpha-numeric characters (a-z and 0-9) for your in-app event names.",

      "URL loading Both Android and iOS implement a native method that listens to url loading events.

The code sets a function to be triggered when a button is clicked. The function itself creates an iframe element that loads a custom URL. It is this URL loading that triggers the native Android or iOS method that then calls the AppsFlyer SDK logEvent method. All the required parameters (event name and event values) are appended to the URL. The Android and iOS code examples below demonstrate how to extract these parameters and pass them to AppsFlyer's SDK logEvent method. When passing event value, keep the following in mind: Make sure to pass the event value as a stringified JSON. \"{\\\"af_revenue\\\":\\\"6.72\\\", \\\"af_content_type\\\": \\\"wallets\\\", \\\"af_content_id\\\": \\\"15854\\\"}\" To avoid any possible problems AppsFlyer recommends using only lower-case alpha-numeric characters (a-z and 0-9) for your in-app event names.

    "title": "Double attribution of retargeting events",
    "answers": [
      "At a glance: To evaluate performance during the retargeting campaign's re-engagement window, in-app events and sessions are double-attributed to the user acquisition (UA) and retargeting media sources. Double attribution of retargeting events In the AppsFlyer attribution model, events occurring as a result of user engagement with a retargeting campaign are attributed to both the media source motivating the install and the media source motivating the re-engagement. In the preceding figure, the UA event is attributed to the green_network. One event is generated. In contrast, after the user engages with a retargeting ad served by blue_network two events are generated. The events credit: blue_network as the primary source motivating the re-engagement. green_network as the secondary source that motivated the original install. To clarify further, the table that follows contains a scenario of how in-app events are attributed before, during, and after a re-engagement window. The notation in the table refers to the raw data fields used to identify double attributed events: is_primary (is_primary_attribution): If true, the media source is the primary media source context: use one of the following fields: [Best practice] conversion_type: install or re-engagement. is_retargeting: if true, the data relates to the retargeting campaign.",

The corresponding record in retargeting in-app event reports during the re-engagement window is populated as follows: Theis_primary_attributionfield is always true.

      "At a glance: What counts as a view? Should a banner appear on a screen or only a part of it? Does the user need to watch the full video or are a few seconds enough to be considered a view? Even when it comes to clicks, it isn't so straightforward: what should happen after or before the click so it is considered viable? This article provides information about the following: AppsFlyer recommended standards for defining a click or view How to send AppsFlyer the details of ad visibility during the engagement Definition of clicks and views Each ad network defines clicks and views differently. This can cause inconsistent and incomplete data. Example A campaign for AwesomeApp includes a video ad that is 10 seconds long.A user sees the ad on two different networks \u2014 first on Network A, then, after a while, on Network B. Each time the user watches it for 4 seconds.After seeing the ad on Network B, the user downloads AwesomeApp and goes straight to the app store. Network A counts a view for a video ad when at least 4 seconds of it has been watched.Network B counts a view for a video ad as 50% of its duration.Network A is reporting this as a view and gets the attribution. Network B doesn't report it, although most likely it motivated the user to download the app. If both networks have the same definition of a view, both would report the engagement. The attribution is awarded to the most recent view. For fairness and consistency, AppsFlyer recommends that its partner networks adopt the following standards:",

    "title": "Aggregated Advanced Privacy framework",
    "answers": [
      "At a glance: Starting with the general availability of iOS 14.5+ and ATT enforcement by Apple, advertisers use the AppsFlyer Advanced Privacy (AAP) framework to control the availability of user-level attribution data from the platform. Aggregated Advanced Privacy framework The AppsFlyer Aggregated Advanced Privacy (AAP) framework prevents tracking across apps and websites owned by different companies and the ability to uniquely identify a user or device. AAP utilizes the Apple App Tracking Transparency privacy levels as a minimum benchmark for its privacy-preserving thresholds. The framework provides advertisers the ability to control the availability of user-level attribution data via the AppsFlyer platform. Starting with iOS 14.5 general availability and ATT enforcement by Apple, if AAP is on, user-level attribution data for non-consenting users running iOS 14.5+ will not be available to advertisers or partners. AAP has no impact on the availability of aggregated attribution data and analytics reports to advertisers and partners. AAP-impacted features If AAP is on, data provided by raw data is affected and some fields are restricted or not available. This affects data provided by the following tools: Data Locker Raw data Pull API Push API Dashboard export page Postbacks to networks Get conversion data (GCD) API in the context of the client-side user-level data API. Data availability is affected when AAP is on as follows: Attribution data and fraud (Protect360): Some attribution fields are restricted or not available. Click, impression, and blocked clicks (fraud) data: User and device-related identifiers aren't available. Deferred deep linking: If you implement deferred deep linking in paid media, use the unified deep linking API (UDL). The legacy API, which uses GCD, can't be used in the context of non-consenting users. In the case of owned media, deferred deep linking for owned media is supported via GCD and the most recent deferred deep linking API. Data availability principles in Aggregated Advanced Privacy When AAP applies to a given user's data, data availability depends on that user's ATT status and the media source bringing the user. Definitions: User-level attribution data: Data records containing device-level identifiers tied to attribution at the user level Limited attribution data for advertisers: Available: Device-level identifiers.

Data sharing rules described apply to a given ad network if either of the following switches is on: AAP: App-level switch AP: Partner-level switch Postbacks for attributed ad networks In the case of the attributed network the postback type used to share data depends on the user consent status as follows: Consenting users: Regular postback containing user-level attribution data including identifiers. Non-consenting users: Advanced Privacy (AP) postback containing limited attribution data. It contains campaign details and no identifiers.

For example, SRN double charges, which occur when users originally attributed to an SRN under your prior vendor, and who are still within the lookback window, are claimed by the SRN again under AppsFlyer. Example A new user clicks on an ad in Facebook and installs your app on June 15. On June 24 the user updates the app to the version with the AppsFlyer SDK, and launches. For AppsFlyer, this is a new user, that needs to be attributed in real-time. AppsFlyer queries Facebook with the user device ID. Because the user is still within Facebook's 28-day lookback window, Facebook self-attributes the user. This causes a double charge to the app owner for the same user. Once you migrate devices, data reflects in AppsFlyer as follows: Installsdata: Similar to re-installs, migrated devices have no install data. Migrated device installs are not displayed in AppsFlyer. In-app events and sessions data: Recorded and displayed as organic for non-attributed device migration method, or attributed to the media source and campaign, if using the attributed method. Retargeting: Re-attributions and re-engagements are displayed normally. Activity data: Displayed normally. Retention and cohort data: Migrated devices have no install record. As such, they aren't associated with any cohort, and can't be shown in the Retention and Cohort reports.",
      " How to migrate devices To migrate devices: Decide which user population to migrate. You can migrate all existing users (which may prevent you from getting accurate re-attribution data from AppsFlyer), or users that only recently installed your app (which may lead to double charges of somewhat older users).We recommend migrating users who are active during your current re-attribution window period. For example, if your app has a 90-day re-attribution window, migrate those users who have at least one session during the previous 90 days. [Optional] Tell the marketer/UA manager to pause existing marketing campaigns (from SRNs, non-SRN ad networks, owned media, etc.) until after the device migration.If you decide not to pause campaigns, migrate any remaining device IDs from the other vendor as soon as the updated app version with the AppsFlyer SDK is released to app stores. Prepare a CSV file based on the user population selected, using either the attributed or non-attributed migration structure. See sample CSV Send your AppsFlyer CSM the CSV.Your CSM will migrate the device IDs to AppsFlyer.",

      " Best practices Override data When pulling and analyzing your data, it is recommended to pull data for a specific date and batch, or override all previous data for the days that the current batch provides. Otherwise, you may see the same data repeated. For example, batch 1 on February 20 contains data for Feb 14-20. But, batches written on February 19 also contained data for Feb 14 to Feb 19. Override the data of the previous days received on February 19 with the data received in the most recent February 20 batch.",

The geo data set is guaranteed to have geo data and the channel data set is guaranteed to have channel data. In many cases and for many media sources, the data in the geo and channel sets will be identical. As such, consume one of the data sets (geo or channel), according to what best suits your needs. If the integration agreement with a given media source doesn't include channel, so that channel is blank, we treat that data as if it contains the channel.",

To extract actionable insight from such potentially huge amounts of data, it is recommended to aggregate the data in a way that best suits your business needs. For example, if you need to understand cost data at the campaign and country-level, use those dimensions.",
      "Standardization across networks Not all networks provide data with the same granularity. For example, Facebook does not provide site ID cost data, while Twitter does not provide geo cost data. Be aware of such cases as you aggregate Cost ETL data, and make sure you look at similar data as you compare networks.",
      "Compare data Cost ETL provides information regarding all your cost data. Some campaigns provided in Cost ETL do not appear in some AppsFlyer dashboards, for example, data of inactive campaigns, meaning campaigns without any recorded installs.

Bliss Point brings exceptional media buying, quantitative rigor, and turnkey solutions to all your offline channels, including OTT, Linear Television, and Digital Audio. Follow these steps to set up the BPM configuration: Set up the Customer User ID, if your mobile developer hasn't yet done this. Set up the BPM integrationwith AppsFlyer. Set up the Customer User ID The Customer User ID (CUID) cross-references your in-house data with AppsFlyer's attribution data, and is set in the SDK. In order for Bliss Point Media (BPM) to be able to match its data with data from AppsFlyer, you must provide the same Customer User ID to both. Note It's important that you put a real Customer User ID, and not a placeholder value. A real Customer User ID is a user ID that you use to identify your customers in your own systems. In AppsFlyer Set up the Customer User IDin the AppsFlyer SDK. In Bliss Point Media Set the Customer User ID in the BPM SDK. You'll also need to provide your app bundle IDs to BPM for both Android and iOS. Consult your Bliss Point Media Contact for details. Set up Bliss Point Media The setup is done from the Integrated Partners page, but to find new partners you must first go to the marketplace. Note Before setting up an integration, make sure you contact the partner and open an account with them. To activate the integration: Go to the Marketplace: From the top menu of any AppsFlyer page, click Marketplace. Search for the partner and select it. Click Set up integration.You\u2019re directed to the integration setup page. In the Integration tab, turn on Activate partner. Note: The toggle must stay on (activated) for as long as you work with the partner. Complete the configuration using the relevant tabs, as described below.

    "title": "Uninstall measurement",
    "answers": [
      "At a glance: Measure the uninstall rate for your app and determine which sources (media sources, campaigns, ad creatives, and geo) bring quality users. Overview To understand the value of your app users, you must analyze both install and uninstall rates. The uninstall metric can help you measure your app's performance, and understand when and why users leave your app. How does it work? AppsFlyer uses silent push notifications, sent once a day, to verify if an app is still installed on a given device. If there is no response, an uninstall is recorded, and it's attributed to the media source that originally brought the user. How to use uninstall data The following are some examples of what you can learn from measuring uninstalls, and how you can use the data to optimize campaigns and user engagement. Compare the quality of sources By comparing the quality of users acquired from different sources (media sources, campaigns, ad creatives, and geo), you can determine the media sources with the lowest uninstall rates, and reallocate funds to them. Example You are a marketer of gaming apps for PlayIt Gaming International. You have just launched a new app and you are running campaigns on two different media sources (Media source A, and Media source B). When you check the dashboard you see that although Media source A has the highest number of installs (10,390), it also has the highest uninstall rate (30%). Media source B, on the other hand, has 5,949 installs and the lowest uninstall rate (12%). Based on these insights, you could reallocate more of your budget to Media source B and try to acquire more engaged users.",
      " Share uninstall data with ad networks for optimization Sending uninstall event postbacks to the ad networks you work with is useful for optimizing user acquisition campaigns. You can send the uninstall event by mapping af_uninstall to your ad network. Once the mapping is complete, an event is sent each time a user is identified as having uninstalled the app. Ad networks can use this information to determine which users are less engaged and focus on getting more engaged users. Example You are a marketer of gaming apps for PlayIt Gaming International. Media source A is an ad network that you are working with on the launch of your new Android app. In the previous campaign you ran with Media source A, 1,000 new users installed your app, and subsequently, 300 users uninstalled the app. For the new campaign, you want Media source A to receive uninstall data. This will allow Media source A to quickly address uninstall challenges. Based on insights from the previous campaign, Media source A creates a campaign exclusion list that excludes specific types of users from ads running in your new campaign: Users who have already proven that they are of lower value for your app. Users who regularly uninstall your apps. This allows Media source A to optimize audience targeting to make sure that your campaign budget is not wasted on users who don't need to see certain campaign ads.",
      " Exclude uninstalls from retargeting campaigns In some cases, to comply with regulations like GDPR and CCPA, you might need to exclude users that uninstalled your app from retargeting campaigns. Uninstall information allows you to create exclusion lists and apply privacy measures to protect your customers\u2019 privacy and data. Methods to exclude users include the following: Raw-data reports: A manual method in which you retrieve a list of uninstalled users from the Uninstalls report and create an exclusion list. AppsFlyer Audiences: An automatic method in which you define a target audience based on specific criteria (for example, users who haven't uninstalled your app). Users that don't meet the criteria are excluded from the audience.",
      "Example You are a marketer of gaming apps for PlayIt Gaming International. You are running a retargeting campaign for one of your Android apps and you decide to use AppsFlyer Audiences to define a retargeting audience. The criteria for your audience is as follows: Users that haven't uninstalled the app. Users that haven't launched the app in the last 30 days. This allows you to create a more exact retargeting audience. When your retargeting campaign runs, ads will only be served to users defined in your retargeting audience.",

      "If you are performing tests on a test version of the app, make sure you are using the sandbox environment. See developer instructions for the uninstall sandbox procedure. Mapping the uninstall event To share uninstall data with an ad network requires mapping the af_uninstall event to a partner. Unlike postbacks for regular in-app events, the uninstall event is not sent in real-time. The event time that is reported represents the time that AppsFlyer determined the app was uninstalled, and not the actual uninstall itself. Keep in mind the following: AppsFlyer can only send the postback if the event actually occurs and is recorded by AppsFlyer. If you don't see uninstalls in the dashboard Overview page or in the raw-data report, this means that uninstall postbacks were not sent to the partner, even if the af_uninstall event was mapped.

    "title": "LTV vs. Activity data",
    "answers": [
      "At a glance: Data in AppsFlyer is either Lifetime Value (LTV) or Activity. LTV data is related to installs occurring during the specified date range. Activity data is all events occurring during the specified date range. LTV vs. Activity There are two methods for analyzing user event data. Event data relates to actions performed by users post-installation, such as in-app purchases, registrations, and level completions. In AppsFlyer, event data is available grouped by the user acquisition date or the event chronological date. Data grouped by user acquisition date is referred to as Lifetime Value (LTV). Data grouped chronologically is referred to as Activity. It's important to understand what they mean and where they're found. Note that installs are neither LTV nor activity. Activity data Activity data are the events performed by active app users during a specified date range. Because activity data shows a breakdown of chronological events, it's useful for measuring the overall performance of media sources during specific date ranges. For example, use activity data to see how many purchase events were performed by all app users during a specific month. Use activity data to compare user behavior in the current month relative to a previous month. LTV data LTV data are the events performed during the lifetime of a user who converted/installed the app in a specific date range. For example, use LTV data to see the ROI up to the present day of users who installed your app during a specific month. Events performed by users who converted/installed the app before the specified date range are not shown in LTV data, even if the event occurred within that range. LTV data is a tool that shows the quality of users from different media sources. Campaign optimization depends on LTV data. Advertisers find both types of data useful but for different purposes. For this reason, both are available. What data can you use to compare media sources? Which pages and reports can you compare in AppsFlyer? How do you compare LTV and activity data? The train analogy This analogy will help you understand the difference between LTV and activity data. Activity: Imagine you're watching a passing train. As the train passes, you see only the actions performed by the passengers on the train as they pass by. This is activity data. LTV: Now imagine, that you board a train as an observer. The train is divided into railroad cars. You board the car with other passengers at the departure platform. This is the install. During the journey, you're able to observe all the actions performed by the passengers in the car. You observe the actions of these passengers until a passenger deboards the train, this is an uninstall. You aren't able to view the actions of passengers in other railroad cars because they boarded the train before or after you. This then is LTV. AppsFlyer dashboards\u2014LTV or activity? The dashboards enable marketers to optimize their non-organic traffic. Most of the dashboards and reports in the platform are LTV-based as marketers typically measure performance on an LTV basis.

      " Comparing AppsFlyer data with external data sources The vast majority of data sources, including Google and Apple, display activity data, that aren't LTV data. Therefore, to compare data from external sources with AppsFlyer data, you would usually use AppsFlyer activity data available in the raw data reports. Consider that Facebook offers partial LTV data, limited to 28 days following the install. Comparing LTV and activity data in AppsFlyer There are two differences between LTV and activity data when looking at the same date range. The differences are: A: Activity data includes events from installs that happened before the date range. B: LTV data includes events that happened after the date range. To compare the two types of data correctly we need to neutralize the differences. This can be achieved by retrieving LTV data from the activity data or vice versa. Note Minor differences between similar sources are still possible due to differences in report generation time. Retrieving LTV data out of raw activity data Go to the Export data page. Set the current day as the last day of the date range (difference B solved). Download the raw in-app events report. Use the Install Time column to filter out installs prior to the first day of the date range (difference A solved).",
      "Note While activity data remains constant over time, LTV data changes when existing users perform new in-app events. The LTV data you see today may be different tomorrow for the same date range. Retrieving activity data out of LTV data To compare the LTV-based overview page with an external source, which is activity-based, you must overcome the two differences. You can only do this by: Selecting sources that started sending installs within the specified date range on AppsFlyer (difference 1 solved).This ensures the activity data does not include events performed within the date range that belong to installs that happened prior to the date range. Setting the current day as the last day of the date range (difference 2 solved).This ensures the LTV data does not include events performed after the date range that belong to installs that happened within the date range. Conclusion When comparing any two data sources, whether both are in AppsFlyer or just one is, make sure to compare activity data with activity data, and LTV with LTV."

Most metrics update continuously in real-time.",
      " Tip If you don't run retargeting campaigns, use the Unified view. If you are familiar with the V1.0 dashboard, you can skip to the quick-start guide below. Terminology Attributions\u2014consist of one or more of the following: Install: The installation of an app by a user. Re-attributions: AKA retargeting reinstall. Re-engagements: User engaging with a retargeting campaign. Organic: Attribution not attributed to a media source. Non-organic: Attribution attributed to a media source. See the AppsFlyer Help Glossary for an in-depth list of all terms. Quick-start guide Power Users View types The dashboard contains user acquisition and retargeting campaign data. The View type filter is used to filter between Unified, User Acquisition, and Retargeting. The same view types are implemented in the Cohort dashboard\u2014power users are familiar with them.

Unified: Installs, re-attributions, and re-engagements User acquisition: Installs Retargeting: Re-engagements and re-attributions The attribution period (dates) relates to the date a user performed an attribution. For example, in the User Acquisition view, it means the install date. In the Unified view, it means any of the attribution types.Note: The retargeting view doesn't contain any cost-related metrics. Use the User Acquisition and Unified views to get the cost-related metrics. Settings and filters You must set a view type and attribution period in the settings and filters panel. The remaining filters are optional. Use the filters for a detailed analysis of your data. Charts Bar/line over time chart. For example, installs per day. Donut/horizontal bar performance comparison.

      "Install report tips Understanding the user journey A user journey is a series of steps that the user performs before achieving a goal like purchasing a product or booking a flight. The idea behind analyzing a user journey is to see what the user does in the app, how active they are, and what value they bring during a given period. You can identify and highlight user journeys with the help of the AppsFlyer ID. The ID is generated for each app install per device. The ID remains unchanged throughout the user lifecycle (from install to uninstall.) The ID persists if the user resets their device ID. Since the install and in-app events reports have the same structure, they can be merged into a single report. In the merged report, you can aggregate and filter by AppsFlyer ID and Customer User ID (if available) to analyze user journeys. Examples Engaged user\u2014strong A user installed the app on August 20 at 09:31. The merged report shows that they made purchases on August 20 at 10:31, August 22 at 15:22, and August 25 at 16:47. From this, we conclude that the user is an engaged user. They made a purchase one hour after launching the app and continued purchasing on the days following the install. Engaged user\u2014weak A user installed the app on July 30. The merged report shows that they added an item to their cart on August 15, but there are no subsequent purchase events. You can assume that the user is hesitant to make a purchase and choose to retarget them with the item they added to the cart. Analyzing the user journey for campaign optimization The user acquisition (UA) manager of a travel app downloads the install and in-app event reports and merges them. Then, to view user journeys in the app, they filter or aggregate data by AppsFlyer ID. They notice that a given user, identified by their AppsFlyer ID, downloaded the app 12 months ago and booked a flight several days later. Subsequently, the user viewed a few flight deals but didn't make any bookings. Looking further, the UA manager discovers more users with the same pattern and decides to dig even deeper. They find that most of these users came from Ad A of Campaign B run on Media source C. It turns out that this ad and campaign targeted users who wanted to travel to a specific destination. By analyzing the user journey, the UA manager might conclude that the campaign was too narrowly focused and that users weren't sufficiently engaged by the app.",

      " Use cases The following sections provide Smart Script use cases for some common campaign/media source scenarios. Facebook Ads\u2014cross-platform attribution Facebook is an SRN that doesn't use external attribution links. Upon first app launch, AppsFlyer queries Facebook whether the user has previously (within the last 7 days) engaged with an ad for the app. If the user has engaged with a Facebook ad of the advertiser, Facebook self-attributes. Facebook also attributes cross-platform, meaning that the user may interact with any type of campaign, mobile or not, on any platform, to be self-attributed by Facebook. Action: Tell your developer to use the skipList method to disable the Smart Script for Facebook (or any other strings you want). If Facebook orany of the strings in the skip list appear in the HTTP referrer of the click, the Smart Script returnsnull. Note: Facebook cross-platform attribution may be affected when users opt not to share their device ID, as is expected with iOS 14 users during 2021.",
      "Google Ads\u2014GCLID and UTM parameters The usual process for install attribution of Google Ads campaigns (which carry a GCLID parameter) requires clicking leads to be redirected to the app's store page URL. Since in this case, you are redirecting leads from Google Ads to a web/landing page, the script takes the GCLID parameter from the Google Ads install campaign URL and puts it into the outgoing URL in your choice of output parameter af_sub[1-5]. Note! This applies to install campaigns. For non-ACI search campaigns, meaning re-engagement campaigns, Google may be attributed as the media source, despite the Smart Script output. Prerequisite:On the Google dashboard, enable auto-tagging. With auto-tagging enabled,the URL contains theGCLIDparameter. To set up the script for Google Ads: Make a list of the media source and campaign parameter names that are in the incoming links.For example: utm_source and utm_campaign. Select a parameter in the outgoing URL to contain the GCLID.Best practice: Select af_sub[1-5], so that the data displays in AppsFlyer raw data reports. Provide these in thelist of parametersto the web developer. Result: The values in the media source and campaign parameters (utm_source and utm_campaign) in the incoming link are used to populate the values for the pid and c parameters in the outgoing link. In the outgoing URL, the GCLID is the value of the af_sub[1-5] param. To notify Google Adsabout these installs: Get the GCLID data from the param af_sub[1-5] via CSV, or Push API in real-time for every install. Upload the GCLID data to Google either manually or via an Adwords API.",
      "Note This GCLID solution is not officially supported or recommended by Google. In case Google deprecates the GCLID parameter we will change the script to support the changes. Follow this article, by clicking the Follow button in the article header, to get informed when there is an update to the article or attached script.",
      " SRNs, owned media, and other media source links SRNs like Snapchat or Twitter, work differently than Google Ads or a cross-platform like Facebook. Campaigns from these SRNs lead your users to the web/landing page, and you are billed according to clicking leads, unrelated to any derived mobile users. For these SRNs, script setup is the same as for links from owned media, or other media sources you might use. To set up the script: Make a list of the media source and campaign parameter names that are in the incoming links. Provide these in thelist of parametersto the web developer.The SRN/media source type should be the media source value in the incoming URL, and the script finds it and uses it as the pid value in the outgoing OneLink URL behind the download button on the web/landing page. If you want to change the outgoing pid, provide the incoming media source value and the replacement pid value in the pid override list. Result: For these SRNs/media sources, the values in the media source and campaign parameters in the incoming link are used to populate the values for the pid and c parameters in the outgoing link. Example Incoming URL: https://hotel.me/af_pid=twitter&af_c=big_social Outgoing URL: https://hotel.onelink.me/Ac4G?pid=twitter&c=big_social",
      " AppsFlyer attribution links AppsFlyer attribution links can be used when the media source is a click ad network. When you set up such a link in AppsFlyer, you have the option to add a Redirection URL path (af_r)parameter with the desired URL path to your mobile website, for web campaign-to-app attribution. Result: If the af_r and af_redirect=true parameters are on the incoming link, the landing page script makes no changes. It leaves the web/landing page direct links to the app stores as they are. Example Incoming URL: https://app.appsflyer.com/id123456789?pid=click_ad_network_int&c=orlando&af_redirect=true&af_r=hotel.me Outgoing URL: Same",
      " Desktop Most use cases in this article are of users coming from mobile devices. Therefore, when directed from the mobile website to an app store, they can immediately download your app. However, desktop users shouldn't immediately be sent to an app store, because their device (a desktop or laptop) isn't compatible with mobile app downloads. To set up the script for desktop users: In your OneLink template, set a destination URL for When link is clicked on desktop. The URL should redirect to a dedicated web/landing page. The landing page can contain a web form where they fill in their details to get an SMS or an email with a link to download the app. It's up to you to create the web form and provide the URL to it in the script. Result: The script detects the device or platform the user is on. If it's desktop, the script generates an outgoing OneLink URL that redirects the user to your dedicated web/landing page. See also Desktop-to-app conversion.",
      "Agencies Installs are attributed to agencies using the af_prt parameter. To add this attribution parameter using the OneLink Smart Script, tell your developer to follow these instructions. Result: The script detects the additional parameter in the incoming URL with the agency name and adds the af_prt parameter to the outgoing URL. Example Incoming URL: https://hotel.me/af_c=gogo&af_pid=email&partner_name=bigagency Outgoing URL: https://hotel.me/pid=email&c=gogo&af_prt=agency",

      "At a glance: Best practices to promote your Android app in the Chinese market. Android apps in China Treat the sections that follow as a checklist of items that you should consider if you market your app in China. Selecting an identifier To achieve accurate attribution a unique identifier (ID) that represents the user is required. On devices where Google Play services (GPS) are active this historically has been the Google advertising ID (GAID). At present GPS is not available on devices marketed in China. App owners are required to use alternative ID based on device hardware being IMEI and Android ID. Starting with Android 10 (API level 29), released in late 2019, access to the IMEI and Android ID is restricted. The effect of this is that the IMEI/Android ID won't be accessible on newer devices. To overcome this, an alternative to GAID, is OAID. OAID (available starting late 2019) is being promoted by Chinese device manufacturers, for example, Huawei. SeeAppsFlyer SDK Integration - Android. Attribution solutions for the Chinese market Since there are multiple Android App stores that serve the Chinese market, AppsFlyer provides the solutions described here to attribute Android installs. Chinese Android device users download apps from different Chinese Android App Stores instead of Google Play and most of these App Stores provide ad units for App Advertisers. Among these App Stores the main ones are Tencent MyApp, 360 App Store, Baidu App Store, Xiaomi App Store, OPPO App Store and Huawei App Store. For example, if you want to promote your Android App via Tencent Social Ads, Tencent Tui Ads and Wechat Ads, upload the Android app to MyApp (Tencent Android App Store), which brings you organic installs at the same time. Baidu series ad networks, 360 Ads, Xiaomi Ads, OPPO Ads all operate in a similar way. Meanwhile, many Android installs are generated from APK download links in mobile web pages or in-app ad space. AppsFlyer provides three main solutions to attribute Android App installs in China market, use the method most relevant to your needs. Local android app store that supports ad attribution Solution: Android out-of-store app with attribution Link Description: The well-known Chinese Internet companies or mobile device manufacturers have created their own Android App Stores and Ad Platforms/Ad Networks, taking advantage of their huge traffic resources in China's domestic market. However, these big companies strictly control traffic to see if the user who clicked on their ad downloads the App from the App Store of a different company. In such situations, you have to generate a unique out-of-Store App for each Android App Store. Meanwhile, you can use the AppsFlyer attribution link to record the performance of the ad campaigns built on those companies\u2019 own Ad platforms/Ad Networks. By using this method, you can attribute both organic install and non-organic installs. At the same time, you can optimize ad campaigns in the term of ad units, ad set and creatives, etc. Example: If you want to promote your Android App via Tencent Social Ads, Tencent Tui Ads, and Wechat Ads, you must upload the Android App to Tencent Android App Store and MyApp, etc, which brings you organic installs at the same time. Baidu series ad networks, 360 Ads, Xiaomi Ads, OPPO Ads all work in the same way. Preparation: How to attribute out-of-store apps, click here.",

      " For mobile web-to-app users, since there are two clicks (the first that directs to the web page and the second that directs from the web page to the app store), attribution and deep linking are problematic. Users who eventually download the app may be wrongfully attributed, or attributed as organic, even if the first click comes from an ad network, Google click, or owned media source. AppsFlyer provides the following solutions for accurate web-to-app attribution: Smart Banners: Add a web SDK into your website, and then create dynamic banners on the AppsFlyer dashboard. When a user clicks a URL and is directed to your mobile website, a Smart Banner pops up with a CTA to download the app from the app store. The Smart Banner URL is populated based on the parameters/UTMs in the incoming link, and is used for attribution. OneLink Smart Script: Runs a script on your mobile website. When a user clicks a URL and is directed to your mobile website, they land on a page with buttons urging them to download your app. The script on the web page dynamically generates the outgoing URLs on these buttons based on the incoming URL, which is used for attribution. Replaces the previous mobile landing page attributionscript. If you are still using the previous script, you should migrate. Both solutions bridge the gap between the incoming campaign URLs to your website, and the outgoing OneLink URL created for correct attribution and deep linking of the mobile website users. The following table compares the two solutions so that you can choose and implement the one most suitable for your needs. Note: You can implement both solutions and use them in tandem.

Dashboard principles The dashboard contains SKAN campaign performance data and adheres to the following principles: Consider that Apple, due to a privacy threshold mechanism, doesn't always populate the conversion value (CV). These are referred to as null CVs. In the case of null CVs, only an install is recorded. Metrics are calculated as follows: Non-organic metrics in the dashboard are calculated using SKAN postback data received by AppsFlyer.

      "Install report tips Understanding the user journey A user journey is a series of steps that the user performs before achieving a goal like purchasing a product or booking a flight. The idea behind analyzing a user journey is to see what the user does in the app, how active they are, and what value they bring during a given period. You can identify and highlight user journeys with the help of the AppsFlyer ID. The ID is generated for each app install per device. The ID remains unchanged throughout the user lifecycle (from install to uninstall.) The ID persists if the user resets their device ID. Since the install and in-app events reports have the same structure, they can be merged into a single report. In the merged report, you can aggregate and filter by AppsFlyer ID and Customer User ID (if available) to analyze user journeys. Examples Engaged user\u2014strong A user installed the app on August 20 at 09:31. The merged report shows that they made purchases on August 20 at 10:31, August 22 at 15:22, and August 25 at 16:47. From this, we conclude that the user is an engaged user. They made a purchase one hour after launching the app and continued purchasing on the days following the install. Engaged user\u2014weak A user installed the app on July 30. The merged report shows that they added an item to their cart on August 15, but there are no subsequent purchase events. You can assume that the user is hesitant to make a purchase and choose to retarget them with the item they added to the cart. Analyzing the user journey for campaign optimization The user acquisition (UA) manager of a travel app downloads the install and in-app event reports and merges them. Then, to view user journeys in the app, they filter or aggregate data by AppsFlyer ID. They notice that a given user, identified by their AppsFlyer ID, downloaded the app 12 months ago and booked a flight several days later. Subsequently, the user viewed a few flight deals but didn't make any bookings. Looking further, the UA manager discovers more users with the same pattern and decides to dig even deeper. They find that most of these users came from Ad A of Campaign B run on Media source C. It turns out that this ad and campaign targeted users who wanted to travel to a specific destination. By analyzing the user journey, the UA manager might conclude that the campaign was too narrowly focused and that users weren't sufficiently engaged by the app.",

Facebook Ads\u2014cross-platform attribution Facebook is an SRN that doesn't use external attribution links. Upon first app launch, AppsFlyer queries Facebook whether the user has previously (within the last 7 days) engaged with an ad for the app. If the user has engaged with a Facebook ad of the advertiser, Facebook self-attributes. Facebook also attributes cross-platform, meaning that the user may interact with any type of campaign, mobile or not, on any platform, to be self-attributed by Facebook. Action: Tell your developer to use the skipList method to disable the Smart Script for Facebook (or any other strings you want). If Facebook orany of the strings in the skip list appear in the HTTP referrer of the click, the Smart Script returnsnull. Note: Facebook cross-platform attribution may be affected when users opt not to share their device ID, as is expected with iOS 14 users during 2021.",
      "Google Ads\u2014GCLID and UTM parameters The usual process for install attribution of Google Ads campaigns (which carry a GCLID parameter) requires clicking leads to be redirected to the app's store page URL. Since in this case, you are redirecting leads from Google Ads to a web/landing page, the script takes the GCLID parameter from the Google Ads install campaign URL and puts it into the outgoing URL in your choice of output parameter af_sub[1-5]. Note! This applies to install campaigns. For non-ACI search campaigns, meaning re-engagement campaigns, Google may be attributed as the media source, despite the Smart Script output. Prerequisite:On the Google dashboard, enable auto-tagging. With auto-tagging enabled,the URL contains theGCLIDparameter. To set up the script for Google Ads: Make a list of the media source and campaign parameter names that are in the incoming links.For example: utm_source and utm_campaign. Select a parameter in the outgoing URL to contain the GCLID.Best practice: Select af_sub[1-5], so that the data displays in AppsFlyer raw data reports. Provide these in thelist of parametersto the web developer. Result: The values in the media source and campaign parameters (utm_source and utm_campaign) in the incoming link are used to populate the values for the pid and c parameters in the outgoing link. In the outgoing URL, the GCLID is the value of the af_sub[1-5] param. To notify Google Adsabout these installs: Get the GCLID data from the param af_sub[1-5] via CSV, or Push API in real-time for every install. Upload the GCLID data to Google either manually or via an Adwords API.",
      "Note This GCLID solution is not officially supported or recommended by Google. In case Google deprecates the GCLID parameter we will change the script to support the changes. Follow this article, by clicking the Follow button in the article header, to get informed when there is an update to the article or attached script.",
      " SRNs, owned media, and other media source links SRNs like Snapchat or Twitter, work differently than Google Ads or a cross-platform like Facebook. Campaigns from these SRNs lead your users to the web/landing page, and you are billed according to clicking leads, unrelated to any derived mobile users. For these SRNs, script setup is the same as for links from owned media, or other media sources you might use. To set up the script: Make a list of the media source and campaign parameter names that are in the incoming links. Provide these in thelist of parametersto the web developer.The SRN/media source type should be the media source value in the incoming URL, and the script finds it and uses it as the pid value in the outgoing OneLink URL behind the download button on the web/landing page. If you want to change the outgoing pid, provide the incoming media source value and the replacement pid value in the pid override list. Result: For these SRNs/media sources, the values in the media source and campaign parameters in the incoming link are used to populate the values for the pid and c parameters in the outgoing link. Example Incoming URL: https://hotel.me/af_pid=twitter&af_c=big_social Outgoing URL: https://hotel.onelink.me/Ac4G?pid=twitter&c=big_social",

Result: If the af_r and af_redirect=true parameters are on the incoming link, the landing page script makes no changes. It leaves the web/landing page direct links to the app stores as they are. Example Incoming URL: https://app.appsflyer.com/id123456789?pid=click_ad_network_int&c=orlando&af_redirect=true&af_r=hotel.me Outgoing URL: Same",

Therefore, when directed from the mobile website to an app store, they can immediately download your app. However, desktop users shouldn't immediately be sent to an app store, because their device (a desktop or laptop) isn't compatible with mobile app downloads. To set up the script for desktop users: In your OneLink template, set a destination URL for When link is clicked on desktop. The URL should redirect to a dedicated web/landing page. The landing page can contain a web form where they fill in their details to get an SMS or an email with a link to download the app. It's up to you to create the web form and provide the URL to it in the script. Result: The script detects the device or platform the user is on. If it's desktop, the script generates an outgoing OneLink URL that redirects the user to your dedicated web/landing page. See also Desktop-to-app conversion.",
      "Agencies Installs are attributed to agencies using the af_prt parameter. To add this attribution parameter using the OneLink Smart Script, tell your developer to follow these instructions.

      "At a glance: Best practices to promote your Android app in the Chinese market. Android apps in China Treat the sections that follow as a checklist of items that you should consider if you market your app in China. Selecting an identifier To achieve accurate attribution a unique identifier (ID) that represents the user is required. On devices where Google Play services (GPS) are active this historically has been the Google advertising ID (GAID). At present GPS is not available on devices marketed in China. App owners are required to use alternative ID based on device hardware being IMEI and Android ID. Starting with Android 10 (API level 29), released in late 2019, access to the IMEI and Android ID is restricted. The effect of this is that the IMEI/Android ID won't be accessible on newer devices. To overcome this, an alternative to GAID, is OAID. OAID (available starting late 2019) is being promoted by Chinese device manufacturers, for example, Huawei. SeeAppsFlyer SDK Integration - Android. Attribution solutions for the Chinese market Since there are multiple Android App stores that serve the Chinese market, AppsFlyer provides the solutions described here to attribute Android installs. Chinese Android device users download apps from different Chinese Android App Stores instead of Google Play and most of these App Stores provide ad units for App Advertisers. Among these App Stores the main ones are Tencent MyApp, 360 App Store, Baidu App Store, Xiaomi App Store, OPPO App Store and Huawei App Store. For example, if you want to promote your Android App via Tencent Social Ads, Tencent Tui Ads and Wechat Ads, upload the Android app to MyApp (Tencent Android App Store), which brings you organic installs at the same time. Baidu series ad networks, 360 Ads, Xiaomi Ads, OPPO Ads all operate in a similar way. Meanwhile, many Android installs are generated from APK download links in mobile web pages or in-app ad space. AppsFlyer provides three main solutions to attribute Android App installs in China market, use the method most relevant to your needs. Local android app store that supports ad attribution Solution: Android out-of-store app with attribution Link Description: The well-known Chinese Internet companies or mobile device manufacturers have created their own Android App Stores and Ad Platforms/Ad Networks, taking advantage of their huge traffic resources in China's domestic market. However, these big companies strictly control traffic to see if the user who clicked on their ad downloads the App from the App Store of a different company. In such situations, you have to generate a unique out-of-Store App for each Android App Store. Meanwhile, you can use the AppsFlyer attribution link to record the performance of the ad campaigns built on those companies\u2019 own Ad platforms/Ad Networks. By using this method, you can attribute both organic install and non-organic installs. At the same time, you can optimize ad campaigns in the term of ad units, ad set and creatives, etc. Example: If you want to promote your Android App via Tencent Social Ads, Tencent Tui Ads, and Wechat Ads, you must upload the Android App to Tencent Android App Store and MyApp, etc, which brings you organic installs at the same time.

Build more specific offerings to retarget your mobile web users, who are also your app users. Seamlessly deep link users from the site to a specific page in the app. Attribution solutions",
      " For mobile web-to-app users, since there are two clicks (the first that directs to the web page and the second that directs from the web page to the app store), attribution and deep linking are problematic. Users who eventually download the app may be wrongfully attributed, or attributed as organic, even if the first click comes from an ad network, Google click, or owned media source. AppsFlyer provides the following solutions for accurate web-to-app attribution: Smart Banners: Add a web SDK into your website, and then create dynamic banners on the AppsFlyer dashboard. When a user clicks a URL and is directed to your mobile website, a Smart Banner pops up with a CTA to download the app from the app store. The Smart Banner URL is populated based on the parameters/UTMs in the incoming link, and is used for attribution. OneLink Smart Script: Runs a script on your mobile website. When a user clicks a URL and is directed to your mobile website, they land on a page with buttons urging them to download your app. The script on the web page dynamically generates the outgoing URLs on these buttons based on the incoming URL, which is used for attribution. Replaces the previous mobile landing page attributionscript. If you are still using the previous script, you should migrate. Both solutions bridge the gap between the incoming campaign URLs to your website, and the outgoing OneLink URL created for correct attribution and deep linking of the mobile website users. The following table compares the two solutions so that you can choose and implement the one most suitable for your needs. Note: You can implement both solutions and use them in tandem.

    "title": "Reinstalls",
    "answers": [
      "At a glance: A reinstall occurs when a user installs an app, uninstalls it, and then reinstalls it. Reinstalls result in one of the following attribution types: non-organic reinstall, organic reinstall, or re-attribution (retargeting). Reinstalls help avoid multiple charges for users that uninstall and install again. What is a reinstall A reinstall occurs when an app user deletes an app and then reinstalls the app during the re-attribution window. The reinstall can come from a retargeting campaign (re-attribution), an organic source, or a non-organic source. Reinstalls that come from an organic source, or a non-organic source, and are in the re-attribution window, are referred to as reinstalls. Reinstalls that come from retargeting campaigns are referred to as re-attributions. They differ in how the reinstall and in-app events are attributed. If an install occurs outside of the re-attribution window, the reinstall is called a new install. A new install is attributed to the media source (or organic if no engagement is recorded) and a new re-attribution window commences.

      "At a glance: Measure the incremental lift generated by retargeting campaigns. Related reading: Running an incrementality experiment |Audiences | Incrementality blog | The 2021 incrementality testing guide for marketers What is Incrementality? Probably the best way to understand incrementality analysis is through an example: Say you recently ran a remarketing campaign. For the sake of simplicity, we'll say it was with only one ad network. The campaign's conversion rate was 5%. Now you want to evaluate the success of the campaign, and you need to answer important (and, of course, the most difficult) questions: Is 5% a good conversion rate for this campaign? How do we know that the campaign truly resulted in driving additional conversions? Was the campaign worth the cost of running it? In order to answer these questions accurately and without bias, we must consider more than just measured conversions. We must take into account the number of users who would have converted organically, even if they had never engaged with a remarketing campaign. This difference between total conversions and those that would have happened anyway is known as incremental lift (or sometimes simply \"lift\"), and it is critical to determining the true value of a campaign. It can be quite difficult to measure, but that is precisely what AppsFlyer Incrementality is designed to do. Incrementality experiments Incrementality overcomes the challenge of measuring incremental lift by allowing you to create scientifically valid experiments to compare the behavior of similar groups. These groups vary only in that some groups (the \"test groups\") are exposed to your campaign, and one group (the \"control group\") is not. Learn more about creating and running Incrementality experiments Calculation methodology The following sections explain the calculations behind the numbers reported on the Incrementality dashboard. Lift AppsFlyer Incrementality employs 2 alternative methods for calculating lift: Intent-to-treat Reach-based While reach-based methodology is preferable for purposes of evaluating campaign performance, its calculation requires the measurement of data points not provided by all ad networks. For these networks, intent-to-treat methodology is used instead. Note Prior to December 16, 2021, lift was calculated using solely the intent-to-treat method. However, data for earlier dates has been updated to utilize reach-based lift where applicable. Therefore, you can review historical experiments to analyze their results in light of the new methodology. ITT-based lift Intent-to-treat (ITT) experimental methodology has its foundations in medical science. Using ITT, researchers randomly split a given population between a control group who are not treated and a test group whom researchers intend to treat. Researchers measure the efficacy of a given treatment by comparing the results of the groups. Whether or not a test group member actually received treatment is not taken into account. Similarly, in remarketing, the lift metric measures campaign efficacy. It doesn't matter if a user in the test group actually engaged with a campaign (received treatment) because it is the intent that is relevant in calculating incrementality. In other words, results are calculated as if every member of the test group actually engaged with the campaign. When is it used? AppsFlyer Incrementality uses ITT-based lift calculation for SRNs. Although it is not the preferred method for measuring lift in our context, ITT remains a scientifically sound experimental method, and it provides valid results when reach-based calculation is not possible. Interpreting results The underlying assumption that all members of the test group were actually reached by a campaign often results in low conversion rates and, as a consequence, low incremental lift. Reach-based lift As its name implies, reach-based lift calculation takes into account whether or not a member of the test group was actually reached (served a campaign ad) prior to converting. In addition to requiring additional data, reach-based lift calculation is also more complex in that it requires certain mathematical adjustments to the control group in order to be statistically valid. These adjustments are cumulatively known as the creation of a \"counterfactual\" control group. When is it used? AppsFlyer Incrementality uses reach-based lift calculation for non-SRNs (attribution-link networks). While it is the preferred method for calculating lift, reach-based calculation requires that ad networks report the following data to AppsFlyer: Impression data Campaign ID (from the attribution link) If this data is not reported, incrementality measurement is not available (and displays as N/A on the Incrementality dashboard). Interpreting results Since reach-based lift calculation takes into account only test group members that were actually reached by a campaign, networks that are measured using reach-based incrementality will usually show amplified results (positive lift will become much higher, and negative lift will become much lower). Best practices Because the 2 different lift calculation methodologies can yield significantly different results, the following best practices are recommended in order to make interpretation more meaningful: When creating your experiments, select audiences that are split only among a control group and one or more networks of the same type, either: Attribution-link networks (non-SRNs) for reach-based calculation; or SRNs for ITT-based calculation In your initial experiments, consider using an audience split only between a single network and a control group. This makes it less likely that comparisons will be made among 2 or more networks for which different lift calculations are used.",
      " Statistical significance When evaluating the validity of Incrementality experiments, sound scientific methodology requires that we consider statistical significance (the level of confidence that the lift result isn't due to random events or chance). On the Incrementality dashboard, significance is reported as a percentage for each media source: The percentage indicates the likelihood that the results for that media source would repeat themselves if the experiment were performed again under similar circumstances. If statistical significance is determined to be below 60%, the dashboard will display Unreliable results instead of a percentage. Significance is affected by audience size, experiment duration, and media source performance.",
      " Scaled control group For test-group-level metrics (as opposed to per-user metrics), lift is calculated based on a scaled control group. In other words, the size of the control group is adjusted to match the control group size for each media source. Example Assume the following scenario: Test group size for Network A = 100 members Control group size = 90 members Experiment results: Network A had 40 conversions The control group had 20 conversions Total conversions will be adjusted based on an assumed (scaled) control group size of 100 members: Assumed members - Actual members = 100 - 90 = 11%  Actual members 90 Actual incremental conversions + 11% = 20 x 1.11 = 22",

About user invite attribution User invites mean your existing app users share links that redirect others (for example, their friends) to download/open your app. User invite attribution means you attribute any new app installs or engagements to the users who sent the referrals. User invite attribution lets you: Analyze the cost and ROI of user invites. User invites use up your app's advertising space, which could otherwise be used to generate ad revenue. You may want to see whether user invites provide better ROI than alternatives. Record information about your users who refer others the most. Users who invite others to your app are high-value, engaged users, who you may want to retarget or incentivize. You can also use data from the links to: Customize the new user's experience.

      " AppsFlyer GDPR Requests API Use the GDPR Requests API as described in this section to implement DSR compliance. GDPR Request:Perform one of the above request types: access, portability, erasure, rectification. Status Request: Query the current status of a GDPR request. Discovery Request:Inquire as to the supported API version and Data Format. Cancellation:Cancel a GDPR request during its pending phase. App Owners must implement UI changes to their app so that App Users can submit requests. Note that GDPR requests are per single user at one time. 1. GDPR request GDPR request flow The GDPR request types, access, portability, erasure, and rectification, have the same flow: App User submits a request. The App Ownerconstructs the GDPR request (see below) and sends it to AppsFlyer. AppsFlyerreceives the request and responds with a \"201 OK\" for valid requests. During the following 48 hours, the request is queued and has apending status. The App User may cancel the request. After 48 hours, the request status changes to in_progress. AppsFlyer sends a status change postback. At this point, the request can't be canceled. Within 14 days (see note below), AppsFlyer fulfills the request, and the request status updates to completed. AppsFlyer sends a status change postback. In the case of erasure or rectification, the App User's data is deleted. In the case of portability or access, the App User's data can be accessed in the AppsFlyer dashboard under GDPR or via the Request API (see below). Note: This 14-day period begins once the 48-hour pending period has ended. Thus, the total period for fulfilling the request is 16 days after the App Owner submits the request to AppsFlyer. GDPR request format A GDPR Request API can be submitted via HTTP POST to the following endpoint - https://hq1.appsflyer.com/api/gdpr/v1/opendsr_requests For the API authorization, use the same V2 API token as for Pull API.

Isn\u2019t expired. Once you confirm the certificate is valid, use it to validate the X-OpenDSR-Signature header against the raw request body. AppsFlyer uses SHA256 RSA as a signing algorithm. Get a response in the status header: 202 Accepted if validation is successful. 401 Unauthorized if the signature fails to validate or the processor domain isn\u2019t in your allowlist.",

      "6. GDPR requests test API This AppsFlyer API is a test API for the AppsFlyer\u2019s GDPR Requests API. How does it work? The test API works as follows: 1. Once a GDPR request has been made, the request is immediately placed in \u2018Pending\u2019 status. For testing purposes, the status changes every 30 seconds. 2. If an endpoint for a status postback has been inserted in the GDPR request, a first postback is sent right after the request and two more status postbacks are sent in 30-second intervals.

      "At a glance: Send events from your servers to AppsFlyer to measure mobile events that occur outside the app. Server-to-server events API for mobile For iOS apps, starting iOS 14, you must send the os (operating system) parameter. The AppsFlyer platform attributes and records mobile app events sent by the AppsFlyer SDK and by APIs. Use the S2S API to report events that take place outside the app; for example, a user renews their subscription using your web interface. S2S events, once recorded, are available across the platform, including dashboards, raw data, and analytics. For PBA web events see Web S2S for PBA. AppsFlyer populates S2S events with: Values sent in the S2S message Some AppsFlyer install attribution values like, install time and media source. To send events via API, tell your developer to follow their server-to-server events API instructions. Populating parameters Difference between organic and non-organic When AppsFlyer processes S2S in-app events, attribution fields are populated by using the AppsFlyer ID to identify the associated install event that preceded the in-app events. What this means is that some data that AppsFlyer associates with non-organic S2S in-app events, is not associated with organic S2S in-app events. Example For example, if you compare raw data reports of non-organic and organic S2S in-app events, non-organic events contain data that organic in-app events do not. Non-organic in-app events include data about the media source, campaign, attributed touch type, and attributed touch time. Organic in-app events, on the other hand, follow an organic install. Organic installs don't have data related to campaign, media source, attributed touch type, and install time.",
      " Mapping AppsFlyer ID with customer user ID (CUID) Backend logic is required to obtain values to populate parameter. The following describes how you can get the AppsFlyer ID: The AppsFlyer ID is mandatory and is used to attribute events. It is generated when a user first installs the mobile app. So that you can map your CUID to the AppsFlyer ID, you must set the CUID in the app. To make it easier for you to know which user performed which event, implement the flow that follows: Set customer user ID when the user installs the app. AppsFlyer raw data reports contain the CUID and AppsFlyer ID. Use one of the data delivery tools to get this or AppsFlyer Push API. Use the raw data reports to match the CUID with the AppsFlyer ID. The AppsFlyer ID is available in the SDK integrated into your app (Android/iOS). Map AppsFlyer ID to customer user ID in your internal systems (important for future use). Once you map AppsFlyer ID with your CUID, you can match the user to events performed. You can then obtain the other values (event value, event currency, event time, etc.) and send the server to server in-app event.",
      "Fetching the AppsFlyer ID appsflyer_id is a mandatory parameter in server-to-server event messages. AppsFlyer uses this parameter to attribute the event to the original device and attributed media source.

Ensure that the AppsFlyer ID you are using to fire the event is a real appsflyer_id and is actually installed on the specific app. Not a test ID provided in the documentation. See here. S2S events don't support multi-events in one S2S request. Each event must be sent as a separate event. Events can be sent with asynchronous method to ease response time. In the overview dashboard, the date range relates to the app install date (LTV) and not to the event date. Make sure you select the correct date range. Make sure that the dashboard date range corresponds to the install date of the device (appsflyer_id) and not the date of the event. Event raw data reports: the date range relates to the event date and not the install date.",
      " Events don't contain revenue If you send S2S events but their revenue is not recorded, ensure that the JSON that you send is stringified. The most important part is the event value parameter in the JSON. It must be stringified as shown in the example that follows. \"{\\\"af_revenue\\\":\\\"6\\\" ,\\\"af_content_type\\\":\\\"wallets\\\"}\" If it is not stringified, then the event value is not processed correctly and revenue is not recorded. Revenue values must not be formatted in any way. They can contain a decimal point. Don't include currency signs or codes nor , delimiters.

      "At a glance: Netcore, an email delivery and analytics platform, embeds AppsFlyer OneLink branded links within emails. Email recipients who click the link are deep linked into your app. Email service providers (ESPs) are excellent sources of segmented user traffic. They wrap deep linking URLs with their own click recording domain. In some cases doing so breaks iOS Universal Links. To overcome this, Netcore uses Universal Links on top of their click recording domain. They integrate with AppsFlyer and by using OneLink branded link capabilities enable deep linking and click recording. Prerequisites OneLink branded link AppsFlyer SDK version: iOS SDK V4.9.0+ Android SDK V4.9.0+",
      "Setting up Netcore Step 1: Setting up domain in Netcore account In order to use Universal Links with Netcore, you need to create a dedicated click recording domain and set a subdomain (for example, click.example.com). This can be done by purchasing a designated domain or using your own domain. Configure tracking domain and sending domain under Netcore Account configuration (see Netcore guide):",
      "Note In case of any issues with Netcore account setup, open a ticket for the Netcore support team. Setting up AppsFlyer Step 2: Configuring your AppsFlyer SDK Note If you haven\u2019t already done so, make sure you have configured your app to support deep linking with OneLink. After configuring your click recording domain to support Universal Links as described previously, you must set up your app to deep-link and resolve Universal Links. Associate the click recording domain in Xcode: Provide the click recording domain to the SDK API setResolveDeepLinkURLs. This API needs to be called before SDK initialization. For more information please see SDK documentation here. [[AppsFlyerTracker sharedTracker] setResolveDeepLinkURLs:@[@\"click.example.com\"]]; When the app is invoked due to a click on the Universal Link, the AppsFlyer SDK resolves the deep link and extracts the underlying OneLink. All deep link parameters are then propagated into the onAppOpenAttribution API for deep link logic execution.

      "At a glance: Create and manage your account's AppsFlyer users, and assign them permissions to access features, apps, and data. Background AppsFlyer accounts allow for multiple users, each with individually-managed permissions. The maximum number of users per account is determined by your subscription plan. Each user\u2019s permissions are defined along 3 primary dimensions: Role (capabilities to access features and perform functions) App access for current and future apps Data access by media source and geo Important! Certain AppsFlyer dashboards and features are unavailable to users with limited data access (to media sources and geos). These dashboards and features are listed here.",
      "Permissions within each of these dimensions are assigned independently. In other words, you may assign a user a role with broad functional capabilities but allow them to exercise those capabilities only within a narrowly-defined set of apps, media sources, and geos. The only exception is the Admin role, as discussed below, which has access to all capabilities, apps, media sources, and geos. More about roles predefined roles hash Each user of your AppsFlyer account must be assigned a role. Each role defines the specific AppsFlyer features the user can access and the functions they can perform. A full list of capabilities per role is available on the Roles tab of the User management page. Roles within AppsFlyer can be predefined roles, custom roles, or (in certain circumstances) temp roles. Predefined roles AppsFlyer is configured with many predefined roles: Admin Team manager Marketing lead Marketing Marketing \u2013 limited Contributor Accounting Security Quality Assurance For each of these predefined roles, the functional capabilities are fixed: no \"mixing and matching\" allowed. However, you can change a user\u2019s functional capabilities at any time by assigning them to a different predefined or custom role (except for the account owner, as discussed below). Example You have assigned Bill Bates the role of Team manager. This role gives Bill the ability to manage OneLink templates, but it does not allow him access to the My plan and Payments pages. Question: Can I keep Bill in the Team manager role but also give him the ability to access the My plan and Payments pages? Can I take away his ability to manage OneLink templates? Answer: No. As long as Bill stays in the Team manager role, you cannot give him the ability to access the My Plan and Payments pages. Nor can you remove his ability to manage OneLink templates. Of course, you can assign Bill to a different predefined role, and his capabilities will change to those defined by that role. Or, you can create a custom role for Bill that changes his capabilities according to your needs. Custom roles The predefined roles in AppsFlyer have been configured with the specific combinations of capabilities required in most situations. For this reason, many advertisers find that they don't need to further customize roles. However, when additional customization is required, predefined roles are still a great starting point for managing your users' capabilities. Learn more about managing custom roles. Temp roles If your AppsFlyer account existed under our prior user management system (when the only available account types were Admin and Team member), all users were brought into the new system with unchanged capabilities. As a result, most of these users appear in the current system with temp roles. Learn more about managing temp roles. Admin\u2014a special role An AppsFlyer account can have one or more Admins, but every account has at least one. This special role has several unique characteristics: The Admin role has access to all account capabilities, including: All features and functions All current and future apps All media sources and geos This \"all-access\" characteristic of the Admin role cannot be changed or limited. account owner hash The user created at the time the account was opened (the \"account owner\") is assigned the Admin role by default. The account owner cannot be deleted, removed from the Admin role, or otherwise edited from the User management page. Likewise, the account owner\u2019s email address cannot be changed. If you do need to change the account owner, follow the steps listed below.

      "At a glance: Data freshness is the period of time between event occurrence and data availability in the platform. Time zones Data freshness and support for app-specific time zones Data freshness The AppsFlyer platform utilizes different types of data freshness, such as daily and real-time. They are used to present and make data available.Each has its own data freshness rate. Example: Data freshness rates on the Events dashboard: Metric KPI: real-time Average KPI: daily Time zones In the AppsFlyer platform, a day starts at 00:01 and ends at 24:00. The default time zone is UTC (GMT). You can modify the default by setting an app-specific time zone. Date and time-zone principles UTC time is constant and doesn't have summer/winter times. Hemispheres Eastern: Time zones designated as UTC+ are those located to the east of UTC. Western: Time zones designated as UTC - are those located to the west of UTC. App-specific time zone You can set an app-specific time zone. This means that the data is grouped into days using local time instead of UTC. Example: Beijing: If the app-specific time zone is set to Beijing (UTC +8), then the day starts at 16:01 UTC and ends at 16:00 UTC the following day. Los Angeles: If the app-specific time zone is set to Los Angeles (UTC -8), then the day starts at 08:01 UTC and ends at 08:00 UTC the following day. Time-zone guidelines Align your app-specific time zone with the time zone you set for other attribution service providers such as Google and Facebook. If you have more than one app, the best practice is to set all apps to the same time zone. To view an app's time zone setting, go to Configuration > App Settings. Most reports and data extraction tools support app-specific time zones. This includes multi-app reports if all apps are set to the same app-specific time zone. Daily processing Some reports and pull-down lists are processed once a day, this is referred to as daily freshness or daily processing. These are the principles of daily processing: Data belonging to a specific day, for example, Monday, is collected in a bucket. The day begins at 00:01 and ends at 24:00 using the app-specific time. Data received up to two hours after midnight is included in the day's bucket. Data received up to 02:00 on Tuesday is included in Monday's bucket. At 02:00 local time, the bucket is closed, and no more data can be added to it. Data received after 0200 is placed in the next available bucket, irrespective of the event date. Daily processing of the closed bucket begins two hours after midnight UTC irrespective of the app-specific time zone. For the sake of simplicity, we state that processing starts at midnight UTC. This means that, depending on the local time zone, the bucket needs to wait until midnight UTC before processing begins. Eastern hemisphere and UTC time zone: Up to 11 hours can pass from the time the day ends (local time) until processing begins. For example: Beijing (UTC+8): Need to wait eight hours before processing begins Berlin (UTC +1): Need to wait one hour before processing begins UTC: No waiting time. Depending on the report type, the data is available 8-20 hours after the start of the processing. For example, Beijing data is available from 16:00 local time. Berlin data is available from 09:00. Western hemisphere: Up to 23 hours can pass from the time the day ends until processing begins. For example: Los Angeles (UTC -8): Need to wait 16 hours before processing begins New York (UTC -5): Need to wait 19 hours before processing begins Depending on the report type the processed data is available 8-20 hours after the start of the processing begins. For example, Los Angeles data is available from 00:01 local time two days after the event. New York data is available from 03:01 local time two days after the event. Example: Events take place on Monday Los Angeles time (UTC -8), the daily processing begins at midnight UTC Tuesday. This is Los Angeles Tuesday 16:01. Eight hours later, on Wednesday 00:01 Los Angeles time, the data processing is complete. In practical terms, data from Monday is available to advertisers in Los Angeles when they begin work on Wednesday morning.",

    "answers": [
      "At a glance: The generic AppsFlyer ad revenue SDK connector works with ad networks to report ad revenue with impression-level granularity. Impression-level ad revenue reporting by SDK connector Ad revenue reporting options Ad revenue is reported to AppsFlyer by either aggregate granularity (via API) or impression-level granularity (via SDK). Impression-level data via SDK: Has better data freshness and earlier availability in AppsFlyer. Supports SKAN. Note: These impressions are collected and processed in AppsFlyer, but aren't counted against your in-apps package. There is anAppsFlyer ad revenue plugin for Unity. Reporting ad revenue using the SDK connector SDK principles of operation The ad revenue SDK connector sends impression revenue data to the AppsFlyer SDK. These impression events are collected and processed in AppsFlyer, andad revenue event, af_ad_revenue , is generated in the platform with the revenue attributed to the original UA source. Data display The af_ad_revenue event is used to identify ad revenue. This event is used throughout the platform including dashboards and other data delivery tools. Supported networks The list of supported ad revenue mediation and monetization networks that can send us data via the generic ad revenue SDK connector is as follows: Unity LevelPlay mediation (formerly ironSource) Applovin Max Google AdMob Fyber Appodeal Admost [Beta] Topon [Beta] Tradplus [Beta] Yandex Unity Chartboost Data freshness The SDK connector sends the revenue data to the platform at the time the ad displays. The data is available in the platform sometime thereafter. (For Day 0 ad revenue attribution beta participants,the data should first become available in the platform\u2019s activity and cohort reports at 5 AM UTC, and every 4 hours thereafter.) Implementing generic AppsFlyer ad revenue SDK connector To implement the generic AppsFlyer ad revenue SDK connector: Enable SDK-level ad revenue in AppsFlyerfor the partner you want to connect. Note: This needs to be done for each app individually. Tell your developer to integrate the generic AppsFlyer ad revenue SDK connector using their Android and iOS instructions. To record ad revenue in your SKAdNetwork dashboard, follow the SKAN ad revenue instructions. Traits and limitations",
      "Trait Remarks Admob For Android and Unity, impression revenue is reported by the Admob iLTV SDK in micro-units. For the correct ad revenue amount in USD to display in AppsFlyer, before sending the ad revenue amount to AppsFlyer, divide the amount extracted from the iLTV event handler by 1 million. Ad revenue value Impression events with revenue values above $10 (and the equivalent in other currencies) aren't processed by the SDK connector."

It can take up to 48 hours for a OneLink short URL to be deleted after the TTL expires. Maximum TTL is 31 days. Any TTL value larger than 31 is overridden with the default TTL of 31. You can change the default TTL by adding the parameterttl={value}and specifying how many days, hours, or minutes. For examplettl=7d,ttl=12h, orttl=10m. You can send an update request to specify the TTL. Any update request resets the TTL (for existing links) to the one specified in the request body. This means the TTL is replaced. For example, if you make an update call with TTL 2d for a link that currently has TTL 29d, it will change to TTL=2d (not 31d). An update call can potentially extend the life of the attribution link. For example, if you make an update call with TTL 31d for a link that currently has TTL 20d but 5 days have passed, the TTL will be 31d from the time of the update.",

Cross-promotion mobile ads don't have a link, but instead, they activate the AppsFlyer SDK logAndOpenStore method. Attributing cross-promotion clicks and impressions is performed by using two separate API calls as described below. Each API call can also be passed a map of key values, which can be anything that fits your cross-promotion use case. For example, using the map of parameters you can set the click lookback window and other parameters such as ad IDs, ad sets. You can also mark the campaign as incentivized campaigns. SeeAppsFlyer attribution parameter for more information. For a list of standard parameters that you can pass to the API method, seeAppsFlyer attribution parameter. With the first launch of the promoted app, all the original parameters can be accessed via the SDK's conversion data API, for Android or iOS. Attribute cross-promotion clicks Use the following code to attribute the click and launch the app store's app page. The code creates an attribution link and adds the device advertising ID to it.

However, non-native platforms can perform cross-promotions attribution just as effectively. These include platforms such as Adobe air, Cordova, Xamarin, React native, Marmalade etc. To do this you need to build an attribution Link, which is invoked when the user clicks on the cross-promotion ad. The link MUST contain the media source name af_cross_promotion and the site ID of the source app. Clicks cross-promotion URL format: http://app.appsflyer.com/{PROMOTED APP ID}?pid=af_cross_promotion& af_siteid={SOURCE APP NAME} Impressions cross-promotion URL format: http://impression.appsflyer.com/{PROMOTED APP ID}?pid=af_cross_promotion& af_siteid={SOURCE APP NAME}"

Folder characteristics: There are 24 h folders numbered 0-23. For example, h=0, h=1, and so on. In addition, a late folder contains events from the preceding day arriving after midnight (in other words, events that arrive between 00:00\u201302:00 UTC of the following day). For example, if a user installs an app on Monday at 08:00 and the event arrives on Tuesday at 01:00, the event is recorded in Monday's late folder.

See Raw data content restriction. This applies to all advertisers, operating systems, and MMPs. It relates to the device-level data for all iOS and Android users, regardless of ATT consent status or ads personalization. AppsFlyer continues to receive device-level data from Facebook, meaning that our attribution and reporting abilities (including multi-touch attribution, LTV, ROI, cohort, retention reports, fraud protection, Audiences, and other services) remain unchanged. See aggregate and analytics reporting tools. How to get user-level data for Android installs? Although user-level data is restricted, Facebook Ads shares campaign metadata with advertisers for Android app ads that direct to Google Play Store. In this case,attribution fields are available to advertisers in the Google Install Referrer which must beintegrated into your app. The fields provided via the referrer populate AppsFlyer raw data reports available to you once the decryption key is submitted and an install is attributed to Facebook Ads. This enables AppsFlyer to attribute users who don't have an advertising ID (LAT-enabled). Note that Google Play Install Referrer is not applicable to retargeting campaigns. Campaign attribution fields available via the referrer: Ad ID Ad name Adset ID Adset name Campaign ID Campaign name Account ID Channel Note! AppsFlyer SDK must be V5.4.0+ for the referrer data to be passed properly. Referrer data has priority over data provided by API and isn't restricted. This solution applies to click-through attribution and not view-through attribution. Data in the referrer is encrypted by Facebook and is decrypted using a key available to you in your Facebook developer account. You must provide us with the decryption key described in the actions required row. The decryption key needs to be submitted only once per app. Note that if the key is not provided or was deleted, there are some cases in which Facebook Ads is still attributed for the install based on the referrer - even without the campaign attribution fields (mentioned in the list above). This happens when: Facebook Ads didn\u2019t claim the install The Facebook install referrer was received but wasn\u2019t decoded And this was the last click.

Scroll down to the Android section and you will see your decryption key labeled Install Referrer decryption key underneath the Package Names field.

      "At a glance: Learn about the differences in attribution models between Facebook Ads and AppsFlyer. Facebook Ads discrepancies with AppsFlyer As any two major players in the mobile user acquisition eco-system, AppsFlyer and Facebook differ in their attribution models. This may cause discrepancies to occur between Facebook and AppsFlyer dashboards. While we work closely with Facebook to minimize these discrepancies, advertisers should be aware of the following causes for them. Detect a discrepancy between AppsFlyer and Facebook Compare events listed in Facebook Event Manager to those in AppsFlyer reports. If the number of events varies significantly, there may be a discrepancy. Differences in attribution models",
      "Cause Facebook AppsFlyer",
      " Click attribution lookback window 7 days (Note that there are some specific cases where the default is different). 1-30 days. Make sure to set to 7 days with Facebook.",
      " View-through attribution lookback window 1 day (Note that there are some specific cases where the default is different). 1 day by default, but can be configured to be 1-48 hours (keep this default value)",
      " Multi-channel sourceattribution Facebook self-attributes installs regardless of other media sources. AppsFlyer uses last-click attribution (more information about AppsFlyer attribution available here)",
      " Cross-device attribution Facebook attributes its users that click and install on different devices, for example, iOS/Android/desktop. AppsFlyer attributes single devices, which perform both the engagement and the install",
      " Different time zones Facebook Ads default reporting time zone is PST. Make sure to change it in Facebook Ads Manager to match the app time zone defined in the app settings in AppsFlyer. AppsFlyer's default app time zone is UTC+0. You can change the time zone set for the app in the app settings page to match the time zone defined in Facebook Ads Manager.",
      " Google install referrer When an install without an advertiser ID was attributed to Facebook Ads using the Google Play install referrer, AppsFlyer doesn't report it back to Facebook Ads. This will cause a discrepancy since it'll display in AppsFlyer and not in Facebook Ads.",
      " Deeplink re-engagement attribution A deeplinked re-engagement is not reported back to Facebook Ads. This will cause a discrepancy since it'll display in AppsFlyer and not in Facebook Ads.",
      " Click-through and view-through attribution AppsFlyer supports both click-through and view-through attribution. To minimize discrepancies between Facebook Ads and AppsFlyer, make sure that both the Click-Through and View-Through Lookback windows are consistent with the default ones defined by Facebook Ads. Facebook Ads' default click-through lookback window is defined to 7 days. Although there are some specific cases where the default is different, it is recommended to set the click-through lookback window in AppsFlyer to 7 days to cover all Facebook Ads' default options. To compare the click-through and view-through attribution windows on Facebook with those on AppsFlyer, visit Facebook. We recommend configuring the attribution windows on AppsFlyer according to Facebook values as they are shown in the following screenshot: Example Suppose that the Facebook click lookback window is configured on AppsFlyer to 1 day for your app com.greatapp, while on Facebook it has the default value of 7 days. Users that click on Greatapp's ad on Facebook, but launch the app for the first time after 2-7 days are attributed as organic users on AppsFlyer, while Facebook self-reports these users. Restricted media discrepancies Until October 28, 2021, attribution data of users brought by view-through attribution (VTA) was restricted and is not available to advertisers.Starting October 29, 2021, the restrictions apply to users brought by both view- and click-through attribution. Aggregated reporting was not affected by this. Since Facebook Ads doesn\u2019t send user-level data, AppsFlyer might not attribute conversion-assisting impressions and clicks to Facebook Ads. Example A user sees or clicks an ad in Facebook for AwesomeApp. Then, later, they see and click on a GreatAdNetwork ad for AwesomeApp and install it. Facebook Ads claims the conversion since it occurred within their lookback window. AppsFlyer attributes the conversion to GreatAdNetwork as they had the last engagement before install. AppsFlyer won\u2019t consider Facebook Ads as a conversion-assisting network since Facebook Ads raw data is restricted. However, for click-through attribution, if the ad directs users to Google Play Store, attribution fields are available to advertisers in the Google Install Referrer. The fields provided via the referrer populate AppsFlyer raw data reports available to you and enable AppsFlyer to attribute users who don't have an advertising ID (LAT-enabled). In-app events differences The differences between platforms may also be present with post-install events (for example, in-app purchases), that are displayed on Facebook and on AppsFlyer. The following table describes the most common reasons for these differences and advised on how to minimize them:",
      "Cause Description AppsFlyer's Tip",
      " Self-attribution Facebook always attributes events to its own campaigns that drove them, while AppsFlyer attributes these events to the acquisition source. Installs and events, which Facebook incorrectly self-attributes, are indicated as assists in AppsFlyer.Combine raw data of Facebook attributed conversions with raw data where Facebook is the contributor.",
      "Different lifetime definition A user's lifetime on Facebook is defined as up to 7 days, meaning Facebook doesn't show events if they occurred over 7 days after the ad click.In AppsFlyer, a Facebook user's lifetime is defined as up to 180 days. When assessing the value of users from Facebook campaigns that occurred after 7 days, use AppsFlyer's data to get a broader picture. Unmapped events AppsFlyer gets SDK originated events, but they are not mapped to Facebook, and therefore aren't sent. Make sure to map with Facebook all the in-app events that signify users' quality. Unsent Revenue AppsFlyer gets the revenue from the SDK originated events, but they are not sent to Facebook. Make sure the Send Revenue boxes of the in-app events are always checked, for example, the purchase event in the capture below. Missing event values on Facebook AppsFlyer sends parameters and values to Facebook as part of the events mapping, if they have the correct structures. Build your SDK in-app events according to AppsFlyer's recommended structures to fully map the event values with Facebook.",
      "Installs from re-engagement campaigns in my UA dashboard? A re-engagement campaign can cause users to open an already installed app(re-engagement). Alternately, when AppsFlyer recognizes a previous install of the app existed on the same device, AppsFlyer may refer to that conversion as a re-attribution. If, on a re-engagement campaign, Facebook targets new users or users that have installed the app for the first time after morethan the set re-attribution window following the original installation, these users are recorded as new user acquisition installs on AppsFlyer, which belong to a re-engagement campaigns on Facebook. On the other hand, installs that take place within the set re-attribution window following the original installation, are considered as re-attributions and appear on the retargeting page of AppsFlyer, while they may be appearing as new installs by Facebook. Note While Facebook shows all installs of a retargeting campaign in the same place, on the AppsFlyer dashboard, installs are divided between the Overview page (new installs) and the Retargeting page (re-attribution and re-engagements). Cross-device attribution Facebook reports on cross-device attribution. This could sometimes cause issues where a campaign for one platform (iOS/Android) shows installs on another platform. Example Linda clicks on a mobile ad of GreatApp on Facebook using her Android phone. Facebook records the click done by Linda under the original Android targeted campaign \"Android Females\". Linda decides to install GreatApp on her home iPad. Upon first launch, AppsFlyer asks Facebook for the origin of this iOS install, and Facebook answers with the campaign \"Android Females\". Validation rules and Protect360 If you use AppsFlyer's Validation Rules, results may differ between AppsFlyer and Facebook when there are rejected installs that originally come from Facebook. In these cases Facebook self-reports installs to itself, while AppsFlyer rejects the same installs. Similarly, if you use AppsFlyer's anti-fraud solution, Protect360, there may be installs since Facebook self-reports, while AppsFlyer rejects. Example Jeff, the UA manager of GreatApp, creates a campaign called SPNA, which targets only Spanish speakers in North America. To verify this Jeff defines a validation rule, that accepts users from Canada and the US only.When a Facebook user from Spain clicks and installs, Facebook self-reports the install, while AppsFlyer rejects the install that doesn't pass the validation rule. SDK related discrepancies There could be several occasions when advertisers implement both AppsFlyer and Facebook Ads SDKs. This might cause discrepancies both for installs and in-app events: Installs: In cases when Facebook Ads SDK is initialized at the app launch, before the AppsFlyer SDK, the install is recorded only by Facebook Ads and not by AppsFlyer. Verify that the AppsFlyer SDK is initialized at app launch, before the Facebook Ads SDK. In-app events: Facebook Ads does not de-duplicate in-app events which are reported from both SDKs. This means that Facebook Ads may report falsely report revenue and other events.Use either of the following methods to avoid duplicate in-app event reporting in Facebook Ads: Don't configure events in the Facebook SDK. Disable the Facebook in-app events mapping from AppsFlyer."

      " Custom in-app events mapping AppsFlyer allows you to map any custom in-app event to send to Facebook, by using the CUSTOM Facebook Event Identifier option. The event name and the event value (including the event parameters) configured in the SDK are forwarded to Facebook, as is, and displayed under its original AppsFlyer SDK event name - not as \"custom\". Note that you are able to use these events to optimize your campaigns. Automatic parameter mapping with the custom event Through the AppsFlyer deep integration with Facebook, many of the AppsFlyer standard SDK event parameters are automatically mapped to Facebook's predefined parameters. For example, the af_revenue parameter is converted to the _valueToSum parameter in Facebook, which allows you to send a revenue per event that can be measured and optimized in Facebbok. Note Automatic parameter mapping can differ between CUSTOM andpredefined events. For predefined events, af_price is mapped to _valueToSum in some cases (for example, fb_mobile_add_to_cart). In other cases,af_revenue is mapped to _valueToSum(for example, infb_mobile_purchase). For events mapped to CUSTOM, af_price is always mapped to fb_price, and af_revenue to _valueToSum.

Non-Latin (English) character sets: As of January 12, 2020, Facebook rejects Chinese characters. AppsFlyer has not tested other character sets and you should use these only after verifying with Facebook if they support these character sets in postbacks. Event names are case-sensitive. To avoid discrepancies, make sure you use the correct case in the event names for all media sources and app versions. Maximum number of parameters: 25. Length of event names and parameters: 2\u201340. Maximum parameter length: 100 characters. Characters permitted: Alphanumeric characters, underscores, hyphens, or spaces. Don't use non-Latin (English) characters. Using non-Latin letters results in inconsistent results. Considerations regarding in-app event naming: Event names on AppsFlyer can be named the same as Facebook event names (for example, fb_price), however, these should not be sent as CUSTOM events to Facebook.To keep on the safe side, refrain from naming events the same as Facebook event names. To perform in-app events postback mapping with Facebook, get events data from all sources, including organic. Important! With the exception of the above parameters, AppsFlyer sends the CUSTOM events data as is to Facebook. It is the responsibility of the app owner to verify the events data is on par with Facebook's requirements. If the event value contains parameters that are not mapped to valid Facebook parameters (see the table above), these parameters are not sent to Facebook."

      " Null conversion values Sometimes the conversion value (CV) has a null value because Apple withholds the actual CV to preserve user privacy. In AppsFlyer, a null CV is counted as an install. Consider: Null and zero have different meanings: Zero: The user installed the app but didn't perform any measurable action during the activity window. Consequently, the metric is accurate and isn't modeled. Null: We don't know what the user did; Apple withheld the CV. Null CVs can distort your performance metrics. To overcome the distortion and provide a truer measure of app performance, null conversion values are modeled to conversion values between 0-63. Modeled conversion values: Use the distribution of SKAN installs with conversion values to model null installs. For example: There are 100 installs, 60 null, 10 with CV=1, 5 with CV=3, and 25 with CV=5. This means that of the 40 installs with conversion values, 25% have CV=1, 12.5% have CV=3, and 62.5% have CV=5.

SKAN modeling is able to model the revenue up to 7 days (168 hours) post-install. Benefits: For SKAN version 3 and earlier, the modeled data extends beyond the timeframe of the activity window. For SKAN version 4+: Data freshness: Revenue LTV becomes available before the second SKAN postback arrives (the postback delay is between 24-144 hours). Measure more: You can use the coarse value configuration of the second and third postbacks for other metrics, like events and retention, and still get revenue LTV data by modeling. Data enrichment: If you use the second postback to measure revenue, data from the postback is used to improve the modeled revenue LTV data and provide revenue data at a more granular level than the 3 levels provided by the postback. Considerations: Revenue LTV metrics display for apps with the overall revenue configuration in SKAN Conversion Studio, for revenue that comes from in-app purchases. Revenue LTV requires at least 14 days of revenue data. Meaning, if you configure Overall revenue on November 1, 2022, the first install date for which modeled data is available is November 14, 2022.

No attribution method provides the full app performance picture. The challenge is to count a given user once because that same user can be attributed by two methods.

      " How to get true iOS 14+ performance data Related reading: SKAN solution guide | SKAN conversion studio | Overview dashboard Starting iOS 14, AppsFlyer attributes iOS users using data from multiple data streams, including SKAdNetwork, ATT consenting users, probabilistic modeling, incrementality-based insights, and dedicated APIs for Apple Search Ads. The absence of IDFA makes it nearly impossible to tie the attribution methods together without including duplicate data. The SSOT mechanism eliminates duplicate install data and corrects the attribution of misattributed users. In other words, users attributed as organic who should have been attributed to a non-organic media source. As a result, the number of installs attributed to a campaign is corrected and the associated cost- and revenue-related metrics, like eCPI, ROI, and ROAS, are also calculated correctly. Simply put, the SSOT mechanism flags SKAN installs which are also attributed using another match type. The flag is considered in calculating aggregated metrics to avoid counting the same user twice. Similarly, you use the flag when processing SKAN raw data. To include the SSOT flag in your data, you must turn on SSOT in the Conversion Studio.

Therefore, each install can be attributed to a non-organic media source either: Via SKAN or an AF model exclusively (unique attribution). Via both SKAN and an AF model simultaneously (duplicates). In this case, the SSOT mechanism signals a SKAN duplicate install with the flag: af_attribution_flag=TRUE. And in the SSOT dashboard, only one install displays instead of two. Neither SKAN nor AF model, meaning the install is organic. The possible SKAN-AF model attribution scenarios are illustrated in the following Venn diagram.

      "SSOT mechanism workings SSOT works as detailed in the visual that follows. How does the SSOT mechanism work? The SSOT mechanism exists in the AppsFlyer SDK in your app on the user device and in the AppsFlyer platform as follows: User device: A user opens the app for the first time. The AppsFlyer platform endeavors to attribute the user. The ability to attribute depends on the campaign type and user consent (ATT) status. If attribution succeeds, the SDK sets the attribution bit in the Conversion Value (CV) The regular SKAdNetwork flow continues unchanged. Meaning that user activity continues to be measured and the CV set until the activity window terminates. Subsequently, iOS sends the postback. AppsFlyer platform AppsFlyer receives the iOS postback, decodes the conversion value, and exposes the value of the attribution bit via the af_attribution_flag as detailed in the table that follows. Considerations In general, AppsFlyer doesn't count reinstalls. In the context of SSOT, the reinstall status isn't considered. This means SSOT doesn't remove duplicate SKAN installs coming from reinstalls in the context of SSOT analytics and they don't affect the setting of the af_attribution flag.",

Postbacks for analytics partners Analytics partners can define the content and endpoints of postbacks sent to them, as part of their integration with AppsFlyer.Postbacks relate to app user engagement like installs, in-app events, re-engagements, and so on. Postback configuration: To request changes to your postback settings, use the partner assistant widget to open a ticket, or contact your AppsFlyer partner development manager. Postback types: Postbacks are available for install and in-app events. Postback macros When included in a postback, macros are replaced with user-relevant data. For example, to get the IP address of the user installing the app, include country_code=(ip) in the postback structure. Supported macros are listed in the following table: Source: Where the data originates from: SDK: AppsFlyer SDK embedded in the app or server-to-server API AF: After processing by AppsFlyer",

      "Test the attribution link for non-SRNs Non-SRN ad networks, which consist of 99.5% of integrated ad networks, use AppsFlyer attribution links. Similarly, owned media attribution is performed by using AppsFlyer custom attribution links. Since correct attribution depends on the parameters of the attribution links, test these links before you start to run a campaign with a non-SRN ad network or a custom attribution link. To test attribution links: Create an attribution link. Send the new attribution link to your registeredtest device (via email or QR code). Click on the link, make sure you're redirected to the app store. Install the app. Launch the app. Check if the install appears in the AppsFlyer dashboard under the partner's media source name. Allow up to 30 minutes for the install to appear in the dashboard.

Instead, SRNs receive queries from AppsFlyer, attribute themselves, and return the answer. Therefore, it isn't feasible to test the integration separately from the network's system as with regular ad networks. You must separately test the integration with each SRN you work with. To test SRN integration: Perform the full SRN setup on AppsFlyer in accordance with the specific partner's setup guide: Facebook, Google Ads, Twitter, Apple Search Ads, Snapchat. Run a new low-budget campaign with the SRN partner. When the partner dashboard displays new installs check if they appear in the AppsFlyer dashboard under the partner's media source name. In the Overview dashboard, drill down to the campaign level, by selecting the partner in the Media source filter, to check that the install appears under the correct campaign name. Allow up to 30 minutes for the install to appear in the dashboard. If necessary, continue to drill down to check the adset and single ad levels. If all is well you can start running new high-budget campaigns with the partner. It is sufficient to test integration once per SRN partner. Meaning, there's no need to test on a per campaign basis.",

To test raw data: After performing the test mentioned previously, go to Reports >Export Data. Select the tested media source. Allow up to 15 minutes from the install and then download the Installs report. Check the install records from the partner exist and include parameters such as the media source, campaign name, touch time and type, device ID (if applicable), agency name (called \"Partner\" in the report), and so on. Important! Some ad networks require special actions to enable the collection of raw user-level data. If you see a new install on the dashboard but don't see it in the raw data, consult the specific Help Center guide for the ad network, for example -Twitter."

Get SKAN postback data from Google Ads If you work with multiple ad network partners, the best practice is to set it up in AppsFlyer. By doing so, SKAN performance metrics for all your ad network partners, enriched with other metrics like cost, are available via the AppsFlyer platform. Related reading: AppsFlyer SKAN Solution guide Scope of SKAN reporting with Google Ads Google Ads shares aggregated iOS SKAN postbacks they receive with AppsFlyer in the context of iOS app campaigns. These postbacks represent installs from multiple channels such as display and YouTube, but generally exclude most of search as SKAN does not support web->app tracking at this point. AppsFlyer decodes the postback and then updates the SKAN dashboard and reports (including the postback raw data report). iOS 14.5 implications on SRN reporting Considerations: On receipt of the iOS postback, Google determines the last click time using ad serving signals. However, AppsFlyer regards the click time as the install time. This can lead to differences between the AppsFlyer and Google dashboards. Because of Google's click-reporting methodology and its retroactive data update on a daily basis, AppsFlyer pulls the data for the previous 13 days and displays the install under the last click before the install date. For example, a click on July 1 can be reported to AppsFlyer until July 13. AppsFlyer displays this install under the click date reported by Google. This impacts reports as follows: Aggregated reports and the dashboard update retroactively. Raw data reports don't change retroactively.

You can use any name for non-integrated sources like email, SMS, or mail pigeons. Avoid common PID issues: Always include PID in your attribution links. Without the PID on the attribution link, the user is automatically attributed to a \"None\" media source and the original installation source is gone. For Custom Sources, use non-integrated partner PIDs. For each integrated source, use only the designated PID for the correct attribution of its installs. For any custom media source, such as email, SMS, or even viral unpaid posts on Facebook use other, non-integrated PID values. Use only legal characters.

      " Site ID parameter The site ID is the unique identifier of the publisher serving the ad. In other words, the website or app displaying the ad. Ad networks allocate unique site IDs for each publisher. This ID is included in the af_siteid parameter passed to AppsFlyer in the attribution link and is made available via the various dashboards, reporting options, and postbacks. The site ID must be passed to AppsFlyer in the attribution link because it: Provides clarity and transparency about the publisher Is used by AppsFlyer to identify and eliminate fraudulent publishers, and other traffic clusters. The site ID parameter only includes the ID of the publisher that serves the ad. To include additional information, such as ad type, placement, or both within the app, for example, banner, interstitial, or video, use the sub-site ID parameter. Example The following attribution link includes: af_siteid (site ID): Publisher ID af_sub_siteid(sub-site ID): Additional ID info (in this case, an affiliate source and ad type placement) https://app.appsflyer.com/com.yourapp?pid=mediaName_int&clickid={clickid}&advertising_id={gaid}&af_siteid=1234&af_sub_siteid=ABCD_4567 In the example link: 1234 = Publisher ID ABCD = Affiliate source (sub-publisher) that the publisher is working with 4567 = Ad type placement within the app, such as banner, interstitial, or video FAQ: Why does traffic result in many blocked installs? Blocked installs can be due to the following: Missing site ID: The af_siteid parameter is empty in the click URL. Engagements sent with an empty Site ID signify either a technical issue or an intentional attempt to bypass fraud detection mechanisms. Multiple site IDs: The same publisher is sent on multiple click URLs, using different site IDs. This is considered fraudulent behavior that masks the real publisher activity and is often associated with click flooding. Site ID formatted incorrectly: Sending the wrong format, combined with other fraud indications, could result in blocking not only the specific publisher, but also of a higher cluster level, and might impact greater volumes of the partner activity. To avoid blocked installs, make sure you send a single site ID parameter per publisher, as shown in the example.",
      "Levels of data granularity You can use up to four URL parameters to deep dive into your ads' performance. Using all 4 parameters on all your active attribution links enables you to: Attribute all user installs and events to specific ads Drill down and compare the performance of all your ads per ad set, per campaign, and per media source on aggregated reports to optimize on every level Compare all of your ads across all media sources on the raw data reports and Pivot table The parameters are: Media source (pid=) campaign name (c=) Ad set (af_adset=) Ad name (af_ad=)",
      "Example The following attribution link uses 4 levels of granularity to record the \"cashmere\" ad in the \"coats\" ad set in the \"winter\" campaign running on the integrated \"network\" media source. https://app.appsflyer.com/com.greatapp?pid=networkx_int&c=winter&af_adset=coats&af_ad=cashmere",

      "FAQ Should I use lower or upper case letters for parameters You can use either, but you must be consistent. If you set a custom parameter with upper or lower case characters, make sure always to use that parameter. For example, if you set pid=MyMediaSource, make sure always to use it. If you use pid=MyMediaSource on one attribution link and pid=mymediasource on another, discrepancies in data might occur. The same goes for any other param that you set on the attribution link.",
      "Is the AppsFlyer attribution link dynamic or static? Attribution links can be dynamic or static.How can you tell if a link is dynamic or static?If the attribution link contains parameters, it's a long pre-defined attribution link, and therefore static.Only short URLs (for example, yourbrand.onelink.me/HaT8/r5c2b371), used for custom attribution links, are dynamic.This means that once you start using an attribution link for an integrated partner, or a long URL for owned media, it would not change for any leads engaging with it, even if you change the attribution link values in the AppsFlyer dashboard. For the change to take place, you must use the new long URL going forward.On the other hand, short URLs for owned media, don't directly contain parameters. When a lead engages with an AppsFlyer short URL, the lead is redirected to AppsFlyer and the current set parameters take place dynamically. What is this Play Store error message? If you ever encounter the following error message in the Play Store after following an attribution Link: This is because the attribution link includes a # character. For example: https://app.appsflyer.com/com.travelco?pid=globalwide_int&clickid=#reqid# Usually, these characters are in the link because they are macros, and are dynamically replaced by a value, so it is not a really big problem and you can ignore the message.",
      "What are subscriber parameters good for? The Subscriber Parameters, meaning af_sub1, af_sub2, ..., af_sub_5 can be used to record any useful KPIs. These parameters get parsed and appear in the raw data report, which makes them very handy for performing data aggregation or filtering. Example A hail ride app, Luber, has creatives with 3 color templates: blue, yellow, and red. Luber's mobile marketer, Linda, wants to test which color template brings in more installs. To do so she adds &af_sub3=blue in the attribution links of all the blue ads across ALL non-SRN media sources. The same is done for the yellow and red ads as well. With this information parsed and appearing in the raw data reports, Linda is able to analyze the success of the different colored ads and pick the best converting one.",
      " What limits are there on campaign names? The maximum length of a campaign name in the attribution link URL is limited to 100 characters. If exceeded, the campaign name is changed to: c_name_exceeded_max_length The campaign name shouldn't start from or end with a white space, as it may cause discrepancies in dashboards and reports"

      "At a glance: Provide attribution link clicks via S2S for users that are sent directly to the app stores. Attribution link flow Caution Don't accumulate S2S clicks and send them in bulk. Send S2S clicks immediately after the user clicks an ad or a banner. Otherwise, AppsFlyer might not attribute the install, which could result in revenue loss for the partner. AppsFlyer relies on clicks for the attribution flow. This means AppsFlyer must log clicks on ads to attribute an install. When a user clicks on a banner or an ad, the following takes place: The user is redirected to AppsFlyer AppsFlyer logs the click AppsFlyer redirects the user to the app store The user installs the app AppsFlyer attributes the install Sending S2S clicks to AppsFlyer If a partner wants to send the user directly to the store, the partner must send the click to AppsFlyer using server-to-server (S2S). Redirecting the user to the store makes for a better user experience by reducing the number of redirections. The S2S click URL is similar to the regular click URL. The only difference is that the S2S URL should include the parameter &redirect=false. This parameter lets AppsFlyer know that this is an S2S click and that the partner is responsible for redirecting the user that clicked. See attribution link parameter dictionary S2S clicks with referrer or device ID Attribution of installs based on S2S clicks relies on the same matching methods described in the AppsFlyer attribution model. The recommended and most accurate methods are Install referrer(Android only) or device ID matching. Aggregated Advanced Privacy and Probabilistic modeling are supported but should be used if other methods are unavailable. Attribution methods available Referrer In cases where a partner redirects the user to the store, the partner can append the Google Play as well as other third-party store'sReferrer to the link that they send to the store and also on the S2S click that they send to AppsFlyer. This allows AppsFlyer to use the referrer as the attribution method for S2S clicks. The ID (referrer) that the partner generates mustbe unique and must adhere to the following: The prefix should be the name of the partner The ID must include the unique transaction ID per click Example: NetworkA_1234567 The store URL should contain the transaction ID under the referrer parameter. Example: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app_name&hl=en&referrer=NetworkA_1234567 The partner should append the referrer on the S2S click that it sends to AppsFlyer. The referrer is appended to the af_ref parameter. See examples that follow.",

If you use SKAN 4 or Custom mode, the bucket range associated with the event and used to calculate skad_revenue is described by min_revenue and max_revenue. (5) In Custom conversion: AppsFlyer calculates install time as the postback arrival time - 36h - average (min_time_post_install + max_time_post_install). However, if CV=0 then average (min_time_post_install + max_time_post_install) is regarded as 0.

Privacy is protected, as this conversion method bypasses SMS, and users don't need to provide private information, such as a phone number for you to text. You can easily attribute installs and measure the efficacy of your ads. QR codes can be created either: Manually, in the AppsFlyer UI Dynamically, using the OneLink Smart Script (specifically designed for web-to-app desktop flows)",

Pick a URL slug for the page such as /app, /download-app, or /mobile-app. Make the page viewable only for desktop/large screen width. For all ads: Make the QR code on your ads large and high-resolution, so that it is easily scannable. Add prominently situated Download from App Store and Download from Google Play badges as visual triggers (not as links). Consider adding instructions on how to scan the QR code. Already using OneLink? In your other custom OneLinks, being used in emails, etc., add an af_web_dp parameter with the value being the URL to the page containing the QR code.

Aggregated campaign performance report This report provides campaign performance data, including the number of unique users performing a given event. You (the ad network), use the data in your BI systems to calculate campaign performance metrics in the context of advertiser KPIs. The report is available daily via Data Locker for Partners Why do you need the report? Before iOS 14.5, the postbacks AppsFlyer sent you, contained sufficient data to calculate unique user event metrics. Starting iOS 14.5, and advertiser adoption of Aggregated Advanced Privacy (AAP), postbacks of non-consenting users don't include user identifiers. The lack of identifiers prevents calculating unique user metrics, for example, 7-day retention. The lack of unique user metrics hurts your ability to optimize campaigns and the ability to set common retention goals with advertisers. What does the report contain?

Field-level considerations Use post-attribution days to enable easy calculation of retention metrics.

Doing so can result in display issues in your mobile website. The App banner solution is iOS-specific, meaning that it does not function on OS X. App install attribution Installs from App Banners are attributed by measuring them as view-through (impression) conversions. AppsFlyer supports view-through attribution only when it includes the Device ID (IDFA). However, for app banner view-through attribution, the Device ID is not provided, so the click recording link is used to measure the view-through conversion. Each time the web page is viewed, a click recording event is sent to AppsFlyer. This includes all the pre-configured attribution parameters (e.g. Campaign Name, pid, Site ID). When the user downloads and installs the app and launches it for the first time, AppsFlyer takes this impression as a candidate for attribution. If this impression is the last touch, this install is attributed to iOS App Banner attribution using Probabilistic modeling. Setting a web page with an app banner and click attribution link Insert the following in the header element of the web page HTML. <meta name=\"apple-itunes-app\" content=\"app-id=123456789\"> Generate an attribution Link for the mobile app you are promoting in the App Banner. The following is an example showing an attribution Link for the mobile app being promoted in the App Banner. You can also use shortened custom attribution links. https://app.appsflyer.com/123456789?pid=ios_smart_banner&c=ios_campaign Insert the generated attribution link inside an image pixel. Your image pixel with the measurement URL is formatted as illustrated. <img src=\"https://app.appsflyer.com/123456789?pid=ios_smart_banner&c=ios_campaign\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" border =\"0\" /> The final HTML page with the image pixel should appear as shown in the following HTML example. <html> <head> <meta name=\"apple-itunes-app\" content=\"app-id=123456789\"> </head> <body> <p>This is my website</p> <img src=\"https://app.appsflyer.com/123456789?pid=ios_smart_banner&c=ios_campaign\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" border =\"0\" /> </body> </html> Note!This code loads and fires a click on both iOS and Android devices. To disable the code on Android devices, add the required logic in your code."

      "What's new Smart Banner settings allow you to choose multiple media source types for attribution. Theyareno longerlimited to one type of web-to-app URL. Effective date August 25, 2021 Where Smart Banners - banner group setup What Before the change:One media source type was supported per banner group.Users needed to choose between using incoming attribution link parameters, OR incoming links with UTM parameters, OR the default attribution parameters (which were also used as a fallback). This meant AppsFlyer looked for either \"pid\" or \u201cutm_source\u201d in the incoming URL. After the change: Banner groups are not limited to one media source type. They can be configured to support one or more of the above media sources. Meaning, users can choose between incoming attribution link parametersAND/OR incoming link UTM parameters AND/OR the default attribution parameters. This provides greater flexibility to customize the link behind the banner and provide the best web-to-app experience for the end-user.",
      "What you must know If you have existing Smart Banners and banner groups, your settings remain the same. For new banner groups, the UI has changed to allow you to choose more than one media source option. You must have the current Smart Banners Web SDK integrated; this feature is not supported by the old (deprecated) Web SDK."

    "answers": [
      "At a glance: The differences between People-based Attribution (PBA) and Google Analytics PBA compared to Google Analytics PBA and Google Analytics are web analytics and conversion measurement solutions. Each focuses on different measurement aspects. PBA also offers additional benefits. PBA is an independent, unbiased attribution authority that focuses on attribution measurement. PBA attributes conversions and revenue to media sources and campaigns that bring users to your website. Google Analytics focuses more on web analytics. It gathers, analyzes, and aggregates data related to user behavior. With Google Analytics you can analyze, for example, user behavior, funnels, web events. Benefits of PBA over Google Analytics The following are the benefits of PBA over Google Analytics: PBA includes: Web-to-app measurement. This metric tells you how many users move from your website to your app. It also tells you which media sources and campaigns bring users to your website who subsequently install your app. Raw data for conversions and events that you can pull into your own BI systems. This gives you the ability and power to run your analysis.",
      "Reasons for differences If you compare data from PBA and Google Analytics, refer to the following reasons for differences in data. SDK implementation The way you implement PBA and Google Analytics could affect data collection. Google Analytics shows more sessions and visitors Cause If Google Analytics loads before the Web SDK users that bounce or users that spend short periods of time on your website are not counted in PBA. This causes discrepancies in data for sessions and visitors. Solution We strongly recommend positioning the Web SDK such that it loads as early as possible. Whether you load the SDK directly or through Google Tag Manager, late loading of the SDK can cause significant discrepancies.",
      "Google Analytics shows more data for sessions, campaign, and conversions Cause The Web SDK is present only on certain pages. Google Analytics is present on all pages. As a result, Google Analytics collects data from all over your website whereas the Web SDK collects data only from certain pages. This causes discrepancies in data for sessions, visitors, campaigns, and conversions. Solution Implement the Web SDK on all pages of your website.",
      "Dashboard settings Dashboard settings such as timezone and data filter could affect how data is presented to you. Timezone settings - discrepancies in data Cause If the timezone settings in your Google Analytics are different from those in your PBA dashboard, you might encounter discrepancies. Example Your AppsFlyer dashboard is configured to UTC and your GA dashboard is configured to UTC +13. This means that your GA dashboard is ahead of your AppsFlyer dashboard by one day. Therefore, data that appears in the AppsFlyer dashboard for March 2nd only appears in your GA dashboard if you choose March 3rd in the date range filter. Solution Make sure time zone settings are the same in both AppsFlyer and Google Analytics.",
      "Data filters -discrepancies in data Issue Both AppsFlyer and Google Analytics allow you to filter data according to date, attributed media sources, campaigns, and events. Different filters in AppsFlyer and Google Analytics can generate different views for the same data. Solution When you compare data from the two dashboards, make sure no filters are applied to the data set.",
      "Conversions and events Different attribution models, lookback windows, how you send events, and cookie settings, can all affect data collection and processing. Lookback window - discrepancies in conversion measurement Cause If you have different lookback windows in Google Analytics and PBA, discrepancies might occur in attribution data. Solution PBA's lookback window is always 30 days. Make sure to set a 30-day lookback window in Google Analytics when youchoose your attribution model.",
      "Attribution model- discrepancies in conversion measurement Cause Different attribution models in PBA and Google Analytics can cause discrepancies in attribution data. Solution Google Analytics offers default attribution models that you can choose from. However, PBA operates in a last non-direct touch, 30-day lookback window attribution model. Make sure to choose a last non-direct touch attribution model in Google Analytics.",
      "Sending events Issue Both Google Analytics SDK and the Web SDK allow you to send events. If you implement one logic for sending events to Google Analytics and another for sending events to PBA, discrepancies might arise. Solution When you send events, verify the following: Make sure that the same trigger applies to both Make sure you send the event to both Google Analytics and PBA Click here to learn how to send events using the Web SDK.",
      "Cookies Both PBA and Google Analytics use cookies to recognize users. Cookie settings in Google Analytics Although it is recommended to let Google Analytics SDK automatically handle cookie settings, you can stillconfigure and change cookie settings. Any change in cookie settings might cause discrepancies. Setting Cookie Expiration Google Analytics allows you to set cookie expiry. If you set the Google Analytics cookie to expire before the Web SDK cookie does, it might cause discrepancies. Example Mark is a constant visitor to your website for over a year now and considers subscribing to premium content. Your developer set the Google Analytics cookie to expire after a year. The Web SDK, however, sets the cookie to expire after two years. When Mark finally subscribes and conversion is registered, the Google Analytics cookie is no longer valid and another is set in its stead. The end result is that Google Analytics shows two users, both of them are Mark, with only one of them having a conversion associated with it. PBA however, shows one user for Mark and the same user that has a conversion associated with it. This means that your conversion rate in Google Analytics is lower than that in PBA. Setting Cookie Subdomain Google Analytics allows you to set cookies for subdomains whereas PBA only sets cookies on the top-level domain. Example You set a cookie to the subdomain store.mywebsite.com. Sharon visits your website and then goes to your online store at store.mywebsite.com. Google Analytics considers heras two different users. Since PBA only sets cookies on the top-level domain mywebsite.com, it considers Sharon in mywebsite.com and store.mywebsite.com as the same user. The end result is two users in Google Analytics and one user in PBA."

Overview AppsFlyer identifies and blocks fraud via: ProtectLITE: Basic fraud protection for all customers. Protect360: Advanced fraud protection for advertisers with a premium subscription plan. Advertisers must give: Ad networks permission to Access Protect360 dashboard and raw data reports (that includes ProtectLITE), and Access aggregate in-app events data (for in-app event fraud). Agencies permission to Access Protect360 dashboard and raw data. With the correct permissions, integrated partners can: View data related to the traffic they generated. Download related raw data reports. There are also raw data reports available to ad networks about click and impression capping, as well as failed click signatures, for which no advertiser permissions are required. Note For advertisers that work with ad networks through an agency, in order for both the ad network and agency to access data, the advertiser must integrateboth the agency and ad network in AppsFlyer, and grant them both permission to access data.

      " Impression and click capping If an ad network has extremely high rates of impression or click fraud, Protect360 blocks the ad network\u2019s impressions or clicks for a 24-hour cycle. This means that any impressions/clicks that occur after the threshold is reached are not recorded by AppsFlyer, nor are they eligible for attribution. The blocked impressions/clicks do appear in the Protect360 dashboard and reports. The AppsFlyer fraud protection algorithm takes into account various parameters when detecting this fraud, including volume of impressions/clicks, CVR, detected fraud rate, normal fluctuations in activity, industry and geographic benchmarks, and proprietary parameters. The algorithm is dynamic and updated on an hourly basis, to take into consideration changing trends. Repeatedly triggering impression or click flooding thresholds may result in the permanent removal of the partner integration from the AppsFlyer platform. Impression and click capping thresholds: Apply to all ad networks equally. Meaning, there is no ad network for which extremely high rates of impression or click fraud would not lead to capping. Are at the ad network level (impressions also take into account app level). Meaning the analysis of fraud takes into account all an ad network\u2019s campaigns and advertisers. And the block affects reporting and attribution for all the ad network\u2019s campaigns and advertisers (whether or not they have Protect360). Are reset after a 24-hour cycle and blocks apply until the end of the cycle. Details on when the cycle starts and ends are kept private by AppsFlyer. Cannot be changed or stopped. Protect360 is finely tuned and accurate in its fraud detection and the algorithm can\u2019t be manually adjusted or turned off. Can be avoided by stopping campaigns and publishers with anomalous activity.",
      " FAQ Impressions and click capping FAQ",
      "Q: What is the network threshold? A: Details of the click capping mechanism are protected to prevent attempts at circumvention. That said, the threshold is only reached if there is an extreme volume of impressions/clicks fired, beyond the possibility of human behavior. Looking at the day\u2019s impression, click and install volumes will give you a clear idea of whether there is a flood issue stemming from one or more publishers. Note: The capping mechanism takes into account all network traffic for all apps, not just a single advertiser's apps.",
      " Q: How can a network get unblocked? A: A network can avoid the threshold by stopping campaigns and publishers with anomalous activity. Once blocked, the network needs to wait until the end of the 24-hour cycle for clicks to resume being recorded.",
      " Q: Does the block affect AppsFlyer customers without Protect360? A: Click capping takes effect regardless of whether or not a customer has Protect360. This is because click capping is network-based; not advertiser-based. The capping mechanism protects all customers and takes into account all network traffic for all apps, not just a single advertiser's apps.",
      " Q: This is not fraud. The network is working with cheap sources and sometimes their quality is low. A: Poor performance at a normal scale from non-suspicious sources does not trigger click capping. The algorithm identifies performance that cannot possibly be human.",
      " Q: This stops us from scaling campaigns and we don't want these impressions/clicks to be blocked. A: The AppsFlyer fraud protection algorithm protects customers from extreme and blatant instances of flooding. It doesn't impact scaling ability, as it addresses non-human generated impressions/clicks, where the vast majority of blocks only cause liabilities.If you have concerns, please contact AppsFlyer to address your issues.",
      " Q: This is not fraud. Maybe AppsFlyer has issues dealing with the volume of impressions/clicks?A: We don't have any issues handling volume. We support some of the world\u2019s largest-scale advertisers and process billions of real-time data points each day, including enormous numbers of legitimate clicks. As part of our commitment to support high-scale growth with rich and accurate data, we act in our customers\u2019 best interests and block clear instances of click flooding.",
      "Q: What is the reason for the change in approach, capping clicks in addition to installs?A: We constantly improve our fraud prevention mechanisms as part of our ongoing commitment to protect customers. Until now, we accepted impressions/clicks and just blocked installs. However, in extreme cases, the click rate is impossibly extreme, and in those cases, there is no sense in accepting them into our systems. Q: What can we do if we expect a significant increase in traffic and impression/click volume (for example, due to new campaigns)? What can be done to avoid being blocked?A: The algorithm is dynamic and updated on an hourly basis, to take into consideration different trends. It is sophisticated enough to handle spikes and is not triggered by normal activity fluctuations, including sudden and significant increases in volume. That said, partners can use their impression/click data and reports to identify suspicious sources and stop those campaigns. Q: How can we check for problematic traffic and improve campaign performance?A: Partners can use their impression/click data and reports to identify suspicious sources and stop those campaigns. Partners can also see blocked impression and click data in the Protect360/ProtectLITE dashboard under the dedicated columns, as long as they have received the required permission from the advertiser to view fraud data in the dashboard.",
      "Q: Are networks sent notification emails regarding capping?A: For click capping, there are two potential notification emails. One alerts the ad network when they approach the click capping threshold (different for every ad network). The second is a notification that the click capping threshold is reached, and lets them know when click recording will resume again. The time between the two emails is dependent on the pace of the flooding. Sometimes there are long intervals, giving the ad network time to take action against the fraud, but other times the intervals could be minutes. For impression capping, ad networks get an aggregated email listing all the apps impacted by capping in the last 24 hours, as well as the 10 site IDs with the most impressions. Note: Even if you stopped campaigns for a particular app, it may appear in the email list if it was impacted by capping in the last 24 hours.",
      "Click signing To prevent click capping, ad networks can add HMAC-SHA256 signatures to their clicks. The signatures enable AppsFlyer to validate the clicks and make sure thatthe click information hasn't been manipulated by fraudsters. Validated clicks are recorded, and attributed to the ad network Invalidated clicks are rejected and: Are aggregated in Protect360 reports made available to the ad network (not advertisers). Do not impact the conversion rate or click capping threshold of the ad network"

      "At a glance: View metrics of SKAdNetwork (SKAN) and AppsFlyer attribution frameworks side-by-side in the Overview dashboard. Identify the framework with the best campaign performance metric for you, then leverage it to gain insights and optimize campaigns. Attribution metrics display side-by-side in the Overview V2.0 dashboard Finding the best iOS 14+ campaign performance metrics Starting iOS 14+, both SKAN attribution and AppsFlyer attribution frameworks generate campaign performance metrics. They attribute differently, have different traits and limitations, and discrepancies between them often occur. For example, SKAN doesn't contain metrics of Apple Search Ads campaigns nor that of owned media. Conversely, AppsFlyer metrics from SRNs don't include installs of non-consenting users. Furthermore, SKAN measures performance during an initial post-install window of 1-3 days, whereas AppsFlyer measures lifetime value (LTV). In side-by-side, you view campaign performance using data provided by both frameworks. Compare the metrics of each framework and decide which metric best represents the actual campaign performance. Data sharing limitation: SKAN metrics in the Overview dashboard aren't available to ad networks and agencies. If SKAN metrics don't display in the dashboard, you must update the table settings.

Explanation The AppsFlyer framework determines installs according to the AppsFlyer attribution model covering different campaign types and attribution methods, whereas SKAN measures installs in the context of paid app-to-app campaigns. Typically, SKAN metrics of SRN campaign installs are higher than those of AppsFlyer, because AppsFlyer only records consenting users.

      " Remedy Consider whether the AppsFlyer attribution metrics accurately represent the entire user population (including users reported via SKAN). If so, use them to extrapolate campaign effectiveness metrics like ROI and conversion rate metrics. To calculate the number of users that converted: Use the AppsFlyer conversion rate metric (per event). Multiply the conversion rate by the actual number of users, derived as described in the campaign precision section. To calculate campaign revenue and ROI: Derive the actual number of users (a) as described in the campaign precision section. Use the ARPU (b) metric provided by AppsFlyer attribution. Calculate campaign revenue using the formula: a * b Use the campaign cost as displayed in the dashboard. ROI = (campaign revenue - campaign cost) / (campaign cost * 100)",
      " Example Calculating ROI Example ROI calculation for campaign a: Assumed number of users 2000 ARPU metric in the dashboard: $0.76 Campaign revenue = 2000 * $0.76 = $1520 Campaign cost: $905.88 ROI= ($1520 - $905.88) / ($905.88 * 100) = 68%",

      "At a glance: Set up your attribution link so that your partners (such as TUNE or CAKE) can receive different postbacks for a single in-app event, based on Goal IDs. Introduction Different postbacks can be sent for an in-app event depending on the Goal ID. This feature supports networks using HasOffers, CAKE, or other networks that want to receive different in-app event postbacks for a single SDK in-app event. On the Integrated Partners page in the dashboard, advertisers map each of their SDK events to the preferred dynamic Event Tag for each partner. The event tag includes both in-app events and rejected in-app event postbacks. This enables ad networks to open multiple campaigns with a separate dynamic event tag (example: HasOffers calls this goal_id) for each campaign. The dynamic event tags are then passed to the ad network in the postback based on the value that was placed in the click URL. Attribution link Attribution Link Example Decoded: https://app.appsflyer.com/com.xyz.abc?pid=mediasource_int&clickid={transaction_id} &goalid_1={XXX}&goalid_2={YYY} The advertiser must map all of the goal_ids in the in-app events section (see below) according to the network's instructions. In the example below, level20_finished is mapped as $$click(goalid_1) and level25_finished is mapped as $$click(goalid_2). When the app user completes level 20, AppsFlyer returns to the relevant value (in this case XXX as it appears in the attribution link above) and sends it in the postback. If the same or a different user then completes level 25 AppsFlyer again returns to the attribution link and dynamically populates the goal_id with the relevant value (in this case YYY) and sends it in the postback."

OneLink offers the following functionality: Detecting user device platforms (Android, iOS) and sending them to the relevant app stores. Deep linking existing users. Providing developers with attribution data to customize content. To create OneLink URLs: Create a OneLink template for the relevant app. Set redirections to app stores or landing pages. Set deep linking for iOS and Android. Once you have a OneLink template, create custom attribution links based on the OneLink template. Step 1: Creating email campaigns with Mailchimp Now you have a custom attribution link that you can put in the body of the email. Follow the instructions from Mailchimp to create an email campaign. In this email, place the custom attribution link behind a call to action button or banner. To help you out, Mailchimp allows you to create emails from email templates. These templates already have structured content with call to action elements built into the theme. Step 2: Customizing content for users When you create custom links, you can add parameters to the link. You can use these parameters to determine what campaigns users come from and serve customized content. To do so, the developer of the app can use methods in the AppsFlyer SDK that return conversion data. See the following: Getting conversion data after an install Getting conversions data after deep linking the user into the app Step 3: Testing your email campaigns Important! Register your device before testing mobile app installs. After following all the required steps mentioned above, creating the appropriate OneLink URL, and placing it in an email, it's time to test. To test a Mailchimp campaign: Turn off email click tracking on Mailchimp. Send yourself the test email. Open the email on your mobile device and click on the link. If you have the app already installed, the app should be invoked. If the relevant AppsFlyer SDK deep linking APIs are implemented, you should be deep-linked into the relevant content. In addition, a click should appear in AppsFlyer data, attributed to the provided media source and campaign. If the app is not installed, you are redirected to the app store relevant to the device. Once you install, the install should appear in the dashboard. The install is attributed to the media source and campaign configured in the OneLink URL."

    "title": "Data Clean Room\u2014Overview",
    "answers": [
      "At a glance: Enrich your user-level data by matching it with AppsFlyer user-level attribution data to create aggregated reports and obtain insights that leverage the value of the combined data. Related reading: Cloud storage and data file setup | Working with sources | Working with reports Introduction Throughout its history, the mobile marketing ecosystem has utilized user-level data to obtain insights and optimize advertising campaigns: Media sources provided user-level data to attribution measurement providers (such as AppsFlyer), who used it to provide attribution, then passed it along to advertisers. Advertisers matched this user-level data to their own user-level data (from BI or CRM systems, for example), then analyzed and grouped it as necessary to obtain the aggregate insights they needed to optimize their campaigns. With the advent of the user-privacy era, access to user-level data from media sources has been significantly restricted: Media sources provide user-level data to attribution measurement providers (such as AppsFlyer), who use it to provide attribution; however, they are now blocked from passing this user-level data to advertisers. This leaves advertisers unable to match user-level attribution data to their own user-level data as they could in the past \u2013 making it impossible for them to obtain the insights they need. This is precisely the \"data blind spot\" that the AppsFlyer Data Clean Room (DCR) steps in to correct. How does it work? Instead of passing user-level attribution data to the advertiser so that the advertiser can match it with its user-level data, the DCR takes on the job of matching user-level attribution data with the advertiser's user-level data \u2013 essentially shifting this responsibility to AppsFlyer. Then the DCR analyzes and groups this data, then passes it along to the advertiser in aggregated form \u2013 allowing the advertiser to obtain the aggregate insights they need while maintaining user privacy. How does the DCR obtain data? The DCR currently uses 2 different types of data: Custom source data: user-level data uploaded to cloud storage for use by the DCR. This data originates from the advertiser's internal systems (such as BI or CRM systems). Attribution data: User-level data provided by the media sources to AppsFlyer for attribution What does the DCR do with the data? The DCR works according to standard database principles. In other words, it matches data from different tables (or \"sources\") into a single data set. This single data set is then used to create reports that use the combined data: In order to match the data from different sources and combine them into a single set, each source must share at least one field that identifies a unique app user (\"identifier\")in common with another source. By using identifiers to match your user-level data with user-level attribution data, the DCR creates a combined user-level data set. Then, in order to provide insights while maintaining user privacy, DCR processes this data to create aggregated reports, grouped according to characteristics (\"dimensions\") that you define. DCR terminology The following are some frequently used DCR terms: Connector: Your (advertiser-owned) AWS or GCS bucket in which DCR data is stored. A connector can include folders for your source data flowing into the DCR and/or destinations for reports flowing out. You can use a single connector or multiple connectors for data flowing in and out of the DCR. Sources: Advertiser source: Your first-party data file that comes into the DCR (intended for matching and enrichment with AppsFlyer attribution data). New versions of source files can be uploaded for processing as often as every 6 hours. When you set up a source in the AppsFlyer DCR platform, you define its structure and location: Source structure: A list of data fields in the source and the category you assign to each for how it will be used in reports (identifier, dimension, or metric). Source location: The cloud service folder from which AppsFlyer obtains the source file each time you update it. This folder lives inside a bucket (\"connector\").",
      "Attribution data: User-level attribution data from your AppsFlyer account (used for matching and enrichment of advertiser data in the DCR)",
      "Report: A data file coming out of the DCR after processing. Reports are created each time new versions of the related source files are uploaded. When you set up a report in the AppsFlyer DCR platform, you define its structure and destination: Report structure: Specification of advertiser sources and attribution data to be used in creating the report, the identifiers by which they will be joined, the metrics to be included, and the dimensions by which the report will be grouped. Report destination: The cloud service folder to which AppsFlyer sends the report each time it is processed. This folder lives inside a bucket (\"connector\").",
      "Working with the DCR (setup workflow) The AppsFlyer Data Clean Room (DCR) is very flexible in terms of the types of data you choose to upload, the reports you receive, and the timing and frequency of processing. For this reason, it involves a relatively significant planning and setup process \u2013 likely involving the collaboration of several people within your organization. Follow these steps to set up the DCR to meet your organization's needs: Consider the reports you want to receive from the DCR. These reports are the result of enriching your advertiser sources with AppsFlyer attribution data. Determine the first-party data sources you need to upload into the DCR in order to create these reports. Create the basic cloud storage structure to support those sources and reports. Define the queries that will pull the data and produce the source data files; produce prototypes of the source data files. Develop the automations that will pull the data, create the source subfolders, and upload the sources and _SUCCESS files on a regular basis. Set up your sources in the AppsFlyer DCR platform. Set up your reports in the AppsFlyer DCR platform. Develop the automations that will ingest the reports after they are delivered by the DCR to your cloud storage."

    "answers": [
      "At a glance: Starting iOS 14.5, Apple requires that you implement and comply with the terms of AppTransparencyTracking (ATT). ATT means that if your app collects data about end-users and shares it with other companies for purposes of tracking across apps and websites, you must use the ATT consent prompt and get user consent in both the publisher and advertiser app. If you don't track, there is no need to display the prompt. Attribution measurement in an ATT environment AppsFlyer provides you with multiple attribution methods giving you a complete range of attribution solutions. The ATT consent requirement impacts attribution in the context of paid app-to-app campaigns. As such, advertisers need to use a mix of attribution and reporting solutions. In the case of paid app-to-app campaigns, SKAN provides deterministic attribution results. Other campaign types like owned media, web-to-app and Apple Search Ads use AppsFlyer traditional attribution tools. The traditional tools provide long-term LTV measurement, whereas SKAN measures user performance during a short initial period post-install. In summary, to obtain a complete picture, use both SKAN and AppsFlyer traditional solutions because they complement one another. This article provides advertisers with an introduction to SKAN and ATT. It is intended for advertisers familiar with the AppsFlyer platform. Related reading: AppsFlyer getting started step-by-step SKAN Solution principles AppsFlyer provides aggregated attribution results using SKAN postbacks from iOS. These postbacks are sent by iOS to ad networks who then forward them to AppsFlyer. The postbacks contain anonymized attribution records enriched with a conversion value (CV) set by the advertiser. The CV is a measure of user quality during an initial post-install window. The AppsFlyer SKAN Solution provides advertisers with: SKAN dashboard aggregating postbacks from all ad networks enriched with other data points like cost. Ability to control what the CV measures without the need to make changes to the app code. The CV can be used to measure revenue, engagement, or conversion events. SKAN limitations Campaigns: Doesn't support, for example, Apple Search Ads, cross-promotion campaigns, and web-assisted installs. Measurement period:The effective measurement period is limited to a few days. For now, the AppsFlyer measurement default option limits the period to the first 24 hours after install. The advertiser sets SKAN measurement settings in the Platform. After the user opens the app for the first time, the Platform instructs the SDK how to calculate the conversion value using the current configuration set by the Advertiser. During the Measurement Window, SDK updates the conversion value for each measurable user action. 24-48 hours after the most recent conversion value update, iOS sends the postback to the ad network. Ad network forwards the postback to AppsFlyer. AppsFlyer validates and decodes the conversion value.Decoded data is: Recorded and attributed before being made available in AppsFlyer via dashboards, reports, and APIs. Sent via a postback to the ad network to enable campaign optimization.",

      " ATT principles The ATT prompt provides advertisers with a way to get explicit user consent allowing the advertisers to collect and share their data. Starting iOS 14.5 IDFA is available only if the user consent via the prompt. Both publisher and advertiser apps display the prompt. If the user provides consent in both apps, it means that the user agrees to be tracked, and advertisers are permitted by Apple to track the user between apps owned by different companies. Setting ATT ATT is set to one of the values listed in the table that follows.Initially, iOS sets ATT to not determined or restricted. Consider that use of the consent prompt to convert a user from not determined to authorized is optional. But, if you don't display the prompt, you can't get authorization.",

Custom sources When defining report structure, you can choose to use data from any of the custom sources you have set up. You must select at least one custom source.",
      "Join sources In order to match data among sources, each of the custom sources used in the report must include an identifier mapped to a key identifier in the attribution data. What is a key identifier? You can map to any of these attribution data identifiers as key identifiers: AppsFlyer ID (af_id): A unique app identifier generated by AppsFlyer at installation \u2013 This ID appears in all events recorded by AppsFlyer. A new AppsFlyer ID is generated if an app is deleted and then reinstalled. ",
      "Customer User ID (CUID): A unique user identifier usually generated and set by the app owner at the time of user registration. Using CUID to map data requires that your app is configured to send the CUID to AppsFlyer via the SDK or the server-to-server API (S2S).",
      "Platform ID + App ID (app_id) Using this option allows you to map to any of the following identifiers: For iOS apps: IDFA or IDFV For Android apps: GAID or Android ID",
      " Important! If you map to Platform ID as a key identifier, you must also map a column in one of the report's custom sources to the attribution data identifier App ID. The App ID is the unique case-sensitive identifier that identifies your app in the AppsFlyer dashboard. It is generally set by the app store in which your app is located and appears in the URL address of the app's page in that app store. Android app ID = package name (such as com.coolcompany.coolapp) iOS app ID = id + 9/10-digit App Store ID (such as id123456789) The custom source column that you map to App ID must be categorized as either an identifier or dimension.",
      " Mapping schemes (direct/indirect) If the report uses more than one custom source, only one of them needs to be mapped directly to an attribution data key identifier. Other custom sources can be mapped either directly or indirectly, as illustrated in the following example: Example In the scenario shown above: Custom source #1 identifier AF is mapped directly to the attribution data key identifier af_id. Custom source #2 is mapped indirectly: user_code --> AF --> af_id. Custom source #3 is mapped indirectly (through a longer chain):user_id --> user_code --> AF --> af_id. Custom source #4 identifier ID is mapped directly to the attribution data key identifier af_id. Note that it could have been mapped indirectly instead (through custom source #3 identifier user_id), but either option works fine.",
      " \u2713 This mapping scheme works to match data among all the sources since each custom source is mapped either directly or indirectly to the attribution data key identifier af_id.",
      " Determine treatment of multiple matching events",
      "Note If the attribution types selected for this report include only installs and/or organic installs, this section is irrelevant. Skip to Select dimensions. If the attribution types you select for your report include re-installs, re-engagements, or re-attributions, it's possible that the attribution data will include more than one event during the selected timeframe with the same key identifier. When this is the case, you must instruct the DCR which matching events it should include in the report. Matching all events The most comprehensive matching method allows your report to include all matching events. In order to achieve this result, you must map an identifier in one of the report's custom sources to the attribution data identifier install_time. The identifier in your source that is mapped to install_time must be in the following format: yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss. Note: Though the name of the attribution data identifier is install_time, it actually means event time when referring to re-install, re-engagement, or re-attribution events. Matching a single event If the attribution types you select for your report include re-installs, re-engagements, or re-attributions but you do not map an identifier to install_time, you must elect to use either the last or first matching event in your report. Last event: The attribution event included in the report is the last event (chronologically) in the timeframe that matches a specific key identifier. First event: The attribution event included in the report is the first event (chronologically) in the timeframe that matches a specific key identifier. Make this selection based on the event you consider to be most relevant to the insights you want to obtain from the report.",
      "Select dimensions Recall that user-level data cannot be reported by the DCR. Instead, it provides you with the decision-making insights you need by aggregating (or grouping) the data by the dimensions you choose. A dimension is generally an attribute by which you categorize app users (for example, geo, install date, campaign, etc.). Selecting report dimensions Attribution data report dimensions can include: Any available attribution data dimension Any field in the custom sources used for this report that has been categorized as a dimension To select the dimensions to include in your report: Select one or more dimensions in the Dimensions from sources list on the left and use the Add button in the middle of the screen to add them to the list of Report dimensions. You can use the search bar to search for dimensions in the lists. To remove a dimension, select it from the Report dimensions list and use the Remove button to return it to the Dimensions from sourceslist. Repeat this process until you have added each dimension you want to include in the report. Note: By default, all reports are grouped by the attribution data dimension media_source. If you do not wish to use this dimension in your report, you can remove it from the Report dimensions list. [Optional] Customizing dimension display names By default, dimension names are displayed in your report exactly as they are named in the attribution data or your custom sources. If you wish, you can customize dimension names for your report. To customize dimension display names: In the Report dimensions list, hover over the name of the dimension whose display name you want to edit. Click the edit button that displays to the right of the dimension. Change the name to the dimension display name to be used in your report (up to 50 characters). Click OK to save the display name, or X to cancel it. Preserving privacy while grouping by dimension (regrouping) Depending on the size of your data set, the number of dimensions you choose, and other factors, it's possible that a report would include one or more groups of only 1 user. Reporting the data in this way would violate restrictions against providing user-level data. However, instead of removing or hiding the data from the report completely, the DCR uses a regrouping mechanism to provide as much detail as possible while maintaining user privacy. Regrouping example Assume you have set up a report according to the following dimensions (in order): Attribution data dimensions: media source campaign adset_name ad_id",
      "Custom source dimensions: user_type",
      "Before regrouping After initial analysis of the data, the DCR determines that the data would break down as follows:",

      "facebook_ads UA_200 green plm654 beg 8 17 1 X",
      " As it stands, the final three rows are not reportable because each row contains only 1 user. According to the regrouping logic, the DCR first \"eliminates\" the last-listed attribution data dimension (which, in this case, is ad_id). It then analyzes the data again to see which rows are reportable. After regrouping After applying the regrouping logic, the report appears as follows:",
      "mediasource campaign adsetname adid usertype revD0 revD7 count reportable?",
      " facebook_ads UA_100 green kjh867 buyer 1 4 12 \u2713",

      "facebook_ads UA_200 green RESTRICTED beg 17 45 3 \u2713",
      " Results: The last row now combines the data that had previously been on 3 rows. The combined row now has a user count of greater than 1 and can be reported. The dimension that was eliminated is now reported as RESTRICTED. Had there still been unreportable rows (number of users=1), the DCR would continue to analyze the data on an iterative basis, eliminating one dimension after another until it either: can report all rows; or runs out of attribution data dimensions to eliminate",
      "Note: By default, the DCR applies regrouping only to attribution data dimensions (not to custom source dimensions). If data grouped by an attribution data dimension would result in a row containing only 1 user, the data in that row will be reported as RESTRICTED. (See below for an advanced option you can use to apply regrouping to custom source dimensions as well). [Optional] Managing dimension priority By default, attribution data dimensions are eliminated in reverse order from the order in which they appear in the Report dimensions list. However, you can modify the default sequence and/or apply regrouping to selected custom source dimensions in order to preserve the dimensions most important to you. To change the order in which dimensions are eliminated: Click the Manage dimension priority button. Select a dimension and drag it to the desired position in the list (or use the arrow buttons on the right to move it).

[Optional] To apply regrouping to custom source dimensions: Click Use advanced options to refine regrouping Select custom source dimensions to which you'd like to apply regrouping. The selected dimensions are added to the Manage dimension priority list. By default, these dimensions are added to the bottom of the list, as Lowest priority for regrouping. However, you can reorder them just like attribution data dimensions as described above.",

    "answers": [
      "At a glance: Attribute app installs to device manufacturers for apps added to devices before leaving the factory. Note: See all other preload attribution methods. Introduction What is a pre-install campaign? Pre-install campaigns allow app owners to reach vast audiences without running online campaigns. In pre-install campaigns, app owners can ask device manufacturers to pre-install their apps on devices before they leave the factory. Pre-install campaigns can also be a collaboration with 3rd party media sources, which work with various manufacturers on behalf of app owners. Important! AppsFlyer counts an install once an app launches for the first time. Therefore, the number of displayed pre-installs is the number of users launching your app, and not the number of devices that have the app pre-installed on. Benefits of recording installs from pre-install campaigns By attributing pre-install campaigns you can measure the: number of users who launch your pre-installed app number of app users each manufacturer brings LTV of each user and determine which manufacturer brings high-value users How can I measure pre-install campaigns? There are four ways to measure pre-install campaigns. For more information, see the Setup section in this article. Viewing pre-install data Pre-installs appear in the AppsFlyer dashboard under the attributed media source, just like any other install event. Their campaign name, however, is always Pre-install. Note You can specify different campaign names for pre-installs with the SDK API Method.",
      "Note Starting May 24, 2022: Match_type for factory preinstall campaigns is displayed as preload_conf in raw data reports. AppsFlyer displays in dashboards the ad network that drove the preload and ad networks that contributed to the first app launch. Learn more about preload campaigns. Setup Select from one of the following methods to measure pre-install campaigns.",
      "Method Name Requires Multiple APKs? Guarantees Pre-install Attribution? Requires Action from Media Source or Manufacturer?",
      " System Properties No Yes Yes SDK API Yes No No Name in Manifest File Yes No No Path Way No No Yes",
      " System properties method (recommended) Use SDK version V4.0+. This method is recommended because it is the most robust of all; however, consider that for all subsequent app installs, the pre-install media source is always attributed. This is regardless of whether the install is new or a reinstall. The system properties method requires actions on both the developer and the manufacturer's side. Developer You need to provide the manufacturer or media source with the APK. The default APK is provided. This method doesn't require a separate APK. Create a file called pre_install.appsflyer. In the file, add a key-value pair: <package_name>=<media_source> For example: com.appsflyer.sampleapp=huawei To specify additional pre-install parameters: In the pre_install.appsflyer file, pass the additional parameters in JSON format. For example: com.appsflyer.sampleapp={\"pid\":\"huawei\", \"c\":\"special_campaign\",\"af_adset\":\"some_adset\"}",
      "Important! It's important to note the following behavior when using this option: In raw-data, it sets Channel to \"Pre-install\" If the pid parameter is not present in the JSON, the Media Source appears as \"None\" in raw-data In the JSON configuration, if the c parameter is not present then the campaign name is set to \"Pre-install\" If the JSON is malformed, the passed string is treated as the Media Source name Once you have the pre_install.appsflyer file, give it to the media source or manufacturer together with the APK. Manufacturer The manufacturer places the pre_install.appsflyer in a file path of its choosing. The pre_install.appsflyer file permissions should be set to 744. The manufacturer then edits the system properties file in order to point to the pre_install.appsflyerfile. To do so, the manufacturer needs to add a key-value pair to system properties. Note Root permissions are required for this step. Root permissions are also required when testing preinstall configuration. See the Testing section for more details. Adding a Key-Value Pair to Android System Properties: adb shell su setprop ro.appsflyer.preinstall.path /data/pre_install.appsflyer An alternative method is to retrieve the system-properties-file from the android file system, edit it, and push it back: adb root adb remount adb pull /system/build.prop echo ro.appsflyer.preinstall.path=/data/pre_install.appsflyer >> build.prop adb push build.prop /system/build.prop adb shell chmod 644 /system/build.prop adb reboot Advantages No need to maintain different APKs for each media source or manufacturer. No need to make changes and add paths to the app on Google Play. Manufacturers can use custom paths and there are no dependencies between multiple preinstalled apps running on different devices. This method ensures attribution to preinstall campaigns and media sources. Even if a user updates the app before launching it or installs the app after clicking an ad, the preinstall is still attributed to the preinstall media source or manufacturer. Disadvantages Some responsibility is transferred over to the media source or manufacturer. The developers need to be sure that the manufacturer or media source takes the necessary steps. Moreover, this method might be a little harder for the app developer to test.",
      "SDK API method The SDK API method provides a native way to specify the manufacturer or media source name to which the pre-install is attributed. To use this method, add the following method call in the AFApplication class before initializing the SDK: setPreinstallAttribution(String mediaSource, String campaign, String siteId) When working with a media source AppsFlyerLib.getInstance().setPreinstallAttribution(\"MEDIA_SOURCE_NAME\", \"CAMPAIGN_NAME\", \"123\"); AppsFlyerLib.getInstance().init(AF_DEV_KEY , conversionListener , getApplicationContext()); When working with a manufacturer AppsFlyerLib.getInstance().setPreinstallAttribution(android.os.Build.MANUFACTURER, \"CAMPAIGN_NAME\", \"123\"); AppsFlyerLib.getInstance().init(AF_DEV_KEY , conversionListener , getApplicationContext());",
      " Note The media source parameter is mandatory. The android.os.Build.MANUFACTURER property holds the manufacturer name as configured by the operating system. Using this property doesn't guarantee that you get the manufacturer name in the same format across devices from that manufacturer. Make sure that this property holds the manufacturer name as expected. The campaign and siteId parameters are optional but are required by the setPreinstallAttribution method. If you don't want to specify campaign and siteId, pass null in both.",
      "Advantages The SDK API method lets you retrieve the manufacturer name programmatically. No matter the manufacturer, the SDK method retrieves the name directly from the device. This means that you can maintain one APK for all manufacturers that you collaborate with. The setPreinstallAttribution method allows you to specify the campaign name. You can separate each manufacturer or media source into different campaigns, rather than have all of them set under the \"Pre-install\" campaign. Disadvantages If you are working directly with manufacturers, you have to maintain two versions of your APK, one for manufacturers and another for Google play. In either case, more than one APK is required. If you are working with several media sources that communicate with the manufacturer on your behalf, you need to maintain a separate APK for each media source. In some cases, the install might not be attributed to the pre-install media source: A user with a new device updates the pre-installed app directly from Google Play without first launching it, the install is considered organic. A user with a new device updates the app from Google Play after clicking an ad, the install is attributed to the media source that serves the ad.",
      "Tip You can implement logic in the app to make sure that the install is counted as pre-install, even if the scenarios above take place. Both the Play Store APK and the APK intended for Pre Install should contain that logic. Example: You know that apps are pre-installed on devices of a given manufacturer and model. These devices are also running with a given carrier. When the app launches, you can check for these conditions when the app launches. If these conditions are met, the install is recorded as pre-install. Since the logic also exists in the Play Store APK, the install is recorded as Pre Install even if the user updates the app before launching it.",
      " Name in manifest file method The name in the manifest method requires you to add a metadata tag to the app's manifest file. You need to repeat this step for every media source or manufacturer that you collaborate with. Add a metadata tag before the closing application tag: ... <meta-data android:name=\"AF_PRE_INSTALL_NAME\" android:value=\"market_name\"/> </application> </manifest> When the app launches for the first time, the AppsFlyer SDK detects this metadata tag in the manifest file and attributes the install accordingly. Advantages The name in the manifest method is considered an easy method for attributing pre-install campaigns. There is only one tag to add to the manifest. In addition, the media source or manufacturer doesn't have to do anything on their end in order to enable campaign measuring. Disadvantages Since the metadata tag specifies the media source or manufacturer name, you need to maintain different sets of APKs, one for each media source or manufacturer. In some cases, the install might not be attributed to the pre-install media source: A user with a new device updates the pre-installed app directly from Google Play without first launching it, the install is considered organic. A user with a new device installs the app from Google Play after clicking an ad, the install is attributed to the media source that serves the ad.",
      " Pathway method",
      "Note Supported by SDK version 4.5.0 or later. This method requires both the developer and the manufacturer to perform some actions on their end. Developer The pathway method allows you to specify a path to a file that holds the name of the media source or manufacturer. There are three steps that you need to complete: Create a file that contains a key-value pair. The file should be called pre_install.appsflyer. In the file, specify the key-value pair in the format of <PACKAGE_NAME>=<MEDIA_SOURCE> For example, com.appsflyer.sampleapp=my_media_source. Passing additional pre-install parameters You can specify additional pre-install parameters in the file using JSON. For example, you can add the following key-value pair in the pre_install.appsflyer file: com.appsflyer.sampleapp={\"pid\":\"huawei\", \"c\":\"special_campaign\",\"af_adset\":\"some_adset\"}",
      "Important! It's important to note the following behaviors when using this option: It sets \"Pre-install\" as af_channel If pid is not present in the JSON, the Media Source appears as \"None\". In the JSON configuration, if c is not present then the campaign name is set to \"Pre-install\" If the JSON is malformed, the passed string is treated as the Media Source name Once you have the pre_install.appsflyer file, give it to the media source or manufacturer together with the APK. Talk to the media source or manufacturer and agree with them on a path where they put the file. The recommended path is \"/data/local/tmp/pre_install.appsflyer\". Once a path is agreed upon, specify it in the manifest file. Place the following snippet before the closing application tag: <meta-data android:name=\"AF_PRE_INSTALL_PATH\" android:value=\"/data/local/temp/pre_install.appsflyer\" />",
      "Manufacturer The manufacturer needs to put the file in the path that is agreed upon. The pre_install.appsflyer file permissions should be set to 744. Once the app launches, the SDK looks inside the manifest file, sees the specified path and looks for the file there. When it finds it, it attributes the install according to the media source that is specified in it. Advantages AppsFlyer looks for the pre_install.appsflyer file in two default paths: /data/local/tmp/pre_install.appsflyer OR /etc/pre_install.appsflyer Some manufacturers prefer to put the file in a non-default path. In such case you can specify this non-default path in the manifest file. Important! Non-default path requires SDK version 4.8 or later Although non-default paths are allowed, we recommend implementing the System Properties method instead. Disadvantages You need to maintain separate pre_install.appsflyer files for different media sources or manufacturers. The manufacturer might want to put the pre_install.appsflyer file in a non-default path. In this case, you need to maintain separate APKS for each non-default path. If a non-default path is used, the install might not be attributed to the pre-install media source: A user with a new device updates the pre-installed app directly from Google Play without first launching it, the install is considered organic. A user with a new device installs the app from Google Play after clicking an ad, the install is attributed to the media source that serves the ad.",

In Android Studio, click on Build in the context menu and choose Clean Project. Build your application in Android Studio and install it on the test device.

The install event is also listed under the \"Pre-install\" campaign. Head over to your AppsFlyer account and open the dashboard for the app that you are testing. Follow the steps below: In the overview page, filter by media sources and choose the media source: In the Breakdown By Campaign graph, you can see that the install that is attributed to \"my media source\" comes from a Pre-install campaign: You can also verify that the install is attributed correctly by viewing the Aggregated Performance Report. In it, you can see the media source and campaign. See the screenshot below where \"My Media Source\" is the media source and the campaign is Pre-install: Repeat the process for all manufacturers or media sources that you collaborate with for pre-install campaigns.",

For system properties or pathway methods - can specify the apps and their corresponding media source in the pre_install.appsflyer file. Each app info shouldbe added in a new line in the file. For example: com.appsflyer.tester=market_name com.newapp.newapp=market_name com.game.king=market_name",
      " Sending install postbacks If the media source or manufacturer that you collaborate with is an AppsFlyer partner, you can enable postbacks for installs. To do so, make sure that the media source name is equivalent to the media source pid as it is configured by AppsFlyer. For example, if you are collaborating with market_name, its pid is market_name_int. You can see the pid by examining the attribution link of an integrated partner.",

If the af_prt (parameter for agency name) is a part of the pre-install data, and the user launches the pre-installed app: The user is attributed to the media source used by the agency (pid=).

      "At a glance: Blueshift, an email delivery and analytics platform, embeds AppsFlyer OneLink branded links within emails. Email recipients clicking on the link are deep-linked into an app. Email service providers (ESPs) are excellent sources of segmented user traffic. They wrap deep linking URLs with their own click recording domain. In some cases doing so breaks iOS Universal Links. To overcome this, Blueshift uses Universal Links on top of their click recording domain. They integrate with AppsFlyer and by using OneLink branded link capabilities enable deep linking and click recording. Set up Blueshift Configure Blueshift and the AppsFlyer SDK, to send emails containing OneLink branded links. For additional information on setting up Blueshift, reach out to Blueshift support or refer to their documentation. Prerequisite OneLink branded link Mobile SDK versions: iOS V4.9.0 or later Android V4.9.0 or later",

Deferred deep linking AppsFlyer allows you to access the user attribution data in real-time directly at the SDK level. It enables you to customize the landing page a user sees on the very first app open after a fresh app install. This is commonly referred to as \u201cdeferred\u201d deep linking. For more details of deferred deep linking, click here. AppsFlyer conversion data contains a parameter called is_First_Launch. The value of is_First_Launch is 'true' on first launches only, and 'false' on all following launches. You can use this parameter to determine on every launch if the app should defer deep link to the user or not. af_dp \u2192 $deeplink_path Example $deeplink_path=product/Banana-Pet-Costume/dd67268672b345e491656c871af8aa29 af_dp includes the encoded URI scheme and pathway af_dp \u2192 %20jet%3A%2F%2Fproduct%2FBanana-Pet-Costume%2Fdd67268672b345e491656c871af8aa29",

You can view the data that AppsFlyer sends on the events page in GA. In your GA dashboard: Click on Behavior in the left-hand side menu Click on Events Click on Overview The screenshot above shows the event categories that AppsFlyer sends to GA. There are three types of events: Organic - installs, sessions, and in-app events of a user whose install is organic Regular - installs, sessions, and in-app events of a user whose install is attributed to a media source Re-Attribution - installs, sessions, and in-app events of a user whose install is attributed to a media source and a retargeting campaign Currently, app open and events from re-engagement are reported but not under a re-engagement category. App open and events following re-engagement are reported to Google Analytics according to the install type that precedes the re-engagement. For example, a user installs the app after engaging an ad. A non-organic install is reported to Google Analytics. Sometime later, the user engages with a reengagement campaign and performs a few in-app events. The app open and next events are reported under a the regular (non-organic) install category. So the events appear under the regular-in-app event category. Viewing install data In the overview page, click on regular-install In the next view, click on Secondary dimension Type the name of the dimension you want to view i.e. campaign or source/medium Choose the secondary dimension The table shows the name of the campaign for each install: Viewing in-app event data In the overview page, click on regular-in-app-event Click on the event In the next view, click on Secondary dimension Type the name of the dimension you want to view i.e. campaign or source/medium. Choose the secondary dimension The table shows the name of the campaign (the selected secondary dimension) for each in-app event: Viewing session data Whenever a user opens the app, AppsFlyer sends an event to GA. The event is af_app_opened. This event is the equivalent of AppsFlyer session. Important! AppsFlyer and Google Analytics each have different definitions of and ways of counting sessions.

Important! The Custom Dimensions method IS NOT RECOMMENDED due to the following: Integrating Google Analytics through AppsFlyer dashboard is simple, quick and easy Integrating Google Analytics using Custom Dimensions is complicated and error-prone Using Custom Dimensions requires you to use both AppsFlyer SDK and Google Analytics SDK Using Custom Dimensions has a greater potential of causing discrepancies Advertisers that use the new integration with Google Analytics don't need to use the custom dimensions method. Note This method requires you to integrate GA SDK into your app. GA SDK for Android GA SDK for iOS Setting media source as a custom dimension on Google Analytics Google Analytics has a powerful tool to create user-level segmentation called custom dimensions. The custom dimension values are sent from mobile devices and your reports are generated, based on these dimensions from your Google Analytics dashboard. Step 1: Define it on Google Analytics Select your app from the GA menu Select Admin at the top bar on GA dashboard On the PROPERTY column select Custom Definition Select Custom Dimensions Create a new dimension. Call it AppsFlyer Media Source and make sure you select User scope. This ensures the data is saved over multiple sessions. Each dimension is created with an index that you must remember so you can later use it in the GA API from your app. In this example, the index of the new dimension is 10. Repeat this step and create another dimension and call it AppsFlyer Campaign Step 2: Setting and sending the data from the app First, you need to get the media source value from AppsFlyer SDK. You can do this using the method onConversionDataSuccess. Note: Starting SDK V5,onConversionDataSuccess is the name of the method for getting conversion data. If you are using an SDK version lower than 5.0.0, the name of the method is onInstallConversionDataLoaded in Android and onConversionDataReceived in iOS. We recommend that you upgrade to SDK 5.0.0. To learn more, click here. Then, you can set the media source as custom dimension using Google Analytics SDK. See the following code samples to learn how to do it: AndroidiOS private static Tracker sTracker; @Override public void onConversionDataSuccess(Map<String, String> conversionData) { if (conversionData.get(\"af_status\") == \"Non-organic\") { String mediaSource = conversionData.get(\"media_source\"); String campaign = conversionData.get(\"campaign\"); sTracker.set(Fields.customDimension(10), mediaSource); sTracker.set(Fields.customDimension(1), campaign); } else if (conversionData.get(\"af_status\") == \"Organic\") { sTracker.set(Fields.customDimension(10), \"Organic\"); } } -(void)onConversionDataSuccess:(NSDictionary*) installData { id status = [installData objectForKey:@\"af_status\"]; if([status isEqualToString:@\"Non-organic\"]) { \t\tid mediaSource = [installData objectForKey:@\"media_source\"]; \t\tid campaign = [installData objectForKey:@\"campaign\"]; \t\t[[[GAI sharedInstance] defaultTracker] set:[ \t\t\t\tGAIFields customDimensionForIndex:10 \t\t\t] value: mediaSource]; [[[GAI sharedInstance] defaultTracker] set:[ \t\t\t\tGAIFields customDimensionForIndex:1 \t\t\t] \t\t\tvalue: campaign]; } \t else if([status isEqualToString:@\"Organic\"]) { [[[GAI sharedInstance] defaultTracker] set:[ \t\t\t\tGAIFields customDimensionForIndex:10 \t\t\t] \t\t\tvalue: \"Organic\"]; } }",

    "answers": [
      "At a glance: Create and manage your agency account's AppsFlyer users, and assign them permissions to access features and apps. Background AppsFlyer accounts allow for multiple users, each with individually-managed permissions. Each user\u2019s permissions are defined along 2 primary dimensions: Role (capabilities to access features and perform functions) App access for current and future apps Permissions within each of these dimensions are assigned independently. In other words, you may assign a user a role with broad functional capabilities but allow them to exercise those capabilities only within a narrowly-defined set of apps. The only exception is the Admin role, as discussed below, which has access to all capabilities and apps. More about roles predefined roles hash Each AppsFlyer user of an agency account is assigned one of 4 predefined roles: Admin Team manager Marketing Contributor Each of these roles defines the specific AppsFlyer features the user can access and the functions they can perform. A full list of capabilities per role is available on the Roles tab of the User management page. As a general rule, all roles are predefined, and each role\u2019s functional capabilities are fixed: no \"mixing and matching\" allowed. However, you can change a user\u2019s functional capabilities at any time by changing their role (except for the account owner, as discussed below). Example You have assigned Bill Bates the role of Team manager. This role gives Bill the ability to manage App settings but does not allow him access to the Audit log. Question: Can I keep Bill in the Team manager role but also give him the ability to access the Audit log? Can I take away his ability to manage App settings? Answer: No. As long as Bill stays in the Team manager role, you cannot give him the ability to access the Audit log. Nor can you remove his ability to manage App settings. Of course, you can assign Bill to a different role, and his capabilities will change to those defined by that role. Temp roles\u2014an exception to the rule If your AppsFlyer account existed under our prior user management system (when the only available account types were Admin and Team member), all users were brought into the new system with unchanged capabilities. As a result, most of these users appear in the current system with temp roles. Learn more about managing temp roles. Admin\u2014a special role An AppsFlyer account can have one or more Admins, but every account has at least one. This special role has several unique characteristics: The Admin role has access to all account capabilities, including: All features and functions All current and future apps This \"all-access\" characteristic of the Admin role cannot be changed or limited. account owner hash The user created at the time the account was opened (the \"account owner\") is assigned the Admin role by default. The account owner cannot be deleted, removed from the Admin role, or otherwise edited from the User management page. Likewise, the account owner\u2019s email address cannot be changed. If you do need to change the account owner, follow the steps listed below. The account owner is initially responsible for creating additional users (until additional users with user management capabilities are created). Only the account owner can retrieve or reset the AppsFlyer API V1.0 token. Any Admin other than the account owner can be changed to a different role or deleted from the AppsFlyer account through the User management page.

Special situations and additional procedures Managing temp roles If your account previously used our prior user management system, temp roles were assigned to existing users to ensure that they were brought into the new system with unchanged capabilities. Users with the same capabilities were assigned the same temp role. Use the features of the Roles tab to review the capabilities of each temp role and a list of users currently in it. Temp role limitations Temp roles were designed specifically to allow seamless transition from our prior user management system. As such, they are available only in limited situations: Temp roles cannot be assigned to other users (whether new or existing). A user with a temp role cannot be assigned a different temp role (though you can change the apps to which they have access). Note that a user's access to future apps cannot be changed while the user is in a temp role. When a user with a temp role is changed to a predefined role, they cannot be returned to the previously-assigned temp role (or to any other temp role). If the last user in a temp role is removed from it, the role will no longer appear in your account.",

But if you find that you must change the account owner, follow these steps to do so. Important! A few things to consider before you begin: Changing the account owner must be completed manually according to these steps. It cannot be done from the User management page. Changing the account owner resets reporting API tokens: Pull, Master, and GDPR. Therefore, you must update your scripts and automated procedures as described below.

      "At a glance: Start measuring the campaigns of your clients by setting up an Agency account.",
      " AppsFlyer attribution model Before you proceed, it\u2019s essential to understand how AppsFlyer\u2019s attribution works. This section explains what happens along the way from the first click or impression to the attribution of an install or an event \u2014 and beyond. A marketer or an agency on behalf of the marketer configures a campaign with a certain ad network, using AppsFlyer attribution links. A user clicks on one of their ads \u2013 for example, a banner or an offer link. AppsFlyer attribution link behind the ad is then populated with information collected during the click. We gather the information from the attribution link and store it in our database. The user is redirected to an app store. The user installs the app and opens it for the first time. The AppsFlyer SDK inside the app calls our servers with the information about the device that the app is installed on. We match this data to our click database using our Attribution methods. If we find a match, we attribute the install to the click. If not, we attribute the install to an organic download. Once the install is attributed, we show it on marketer and agency dashboards and reports (except Facebook and Twitter). Then, we send a postback with the conversion details to the ad network, who can use this information for further optimization. Agency role in mobile attribution chain A marketer, who owns the app, integrates AppsFlyer SDK inside it in order to quantify their marketing effort. Some app owners choose to hire marketing agencies to run advertising campaigns on their behalf. To do so, the agency should have an AppsFlyer account, and marketers should give the agency access to their apps. Agency, therefore, doesn\u2019t technically own the apps but only promotes them on the marketing channels it works with, without the technical involvement, such an SDK integration. Depending on the set of permissions given by a marketer, an agency can have control over a range of functions. When an install is attributed to an ad placed by an agency, it is displayed on agency's dashboard. The app owner will see it too, and will know that it's attributed to the agency. Note: if your organization owns the app, or handles its development as well as marketing, you should open a marketer account. Pricing The scope of an agency account functionalitydepends on the permissions provided by the app owner for each app. Therefore, agency accounts are offered for free, and only app owners are charged for attribution. App owners and agencies can use AppsFlyer attribution data for compensation purposes. Getting started To set up a new agency account: Complete the registration form. Use your company email domain for registration. Use an email address that is not associated with an existing AppsFlyer account. A member of the AppsFlyer agency team may contact you with further information required to complete the registration. Once your account is activated, you get notified and can start using AppsFlyer. Adding team members When your account is up and running, the account admin (the person who opened the account) can add more team members, who can get access to some or all of the apps managed by the agency. For the details of how to add new team members, click here. Adding apps to your account When you first create your account, it has no apps associated with it: Any agency individual or team requires permission from the app owner to: gain access to the app dashboard make configuration changes run campaigns Marketers provide access to any agency directly through the platform. Once your account is set up and you've received access to the apps, you can start running campaigns using AppsFlyer features. What does it mean to get permission from a marketer When you get permission from a marketer: The app appears in your account. You can set up integrations with ad networks for the app (with the exception of some networks that require configuration by the app owner). You can create attribution links to use in your campaigns. You can set up cost integrations with partners (that allow it). You can see the app data. You can grant permission for ad networks and their team membersto view basic information about the app.This means that when an agency and the marketer are working with an ad network, both of you can edit the ad network team members' permissions so that they can view the app dashboard and see changes made by each other. So for example, if you see new ad network team members that you didn\u2019t add, or team members that you didn't remove are missing, it\u2019s possible that the marketer added or removed them. Additional permissions include access to Cohort report, Protect360 dashboard, and aggregate organic data. App list Once you got permission from the marketer, the app appears on the app's page. The apps page in your account lists up to 1000 apps. If the list of apps you have permissions for exceeds 1000, some apps are not shown on the list. You can still find them using the search. Searching for apps In your account, click My Apps in the top menu In the search field, enter the search term, for example: App Name App ID App Owner Email",
      "Transparency Depending on your agreement with the app owner, you may prefer to disclose media sources of the conversions coming from your agency or conceal them. While agencies can decide not to disclose their media sources, bear in mind that the industry keeps shifting towards a more transparent ecosystem. This is already applied to a high percentage of traffic - SKAN, Facebook Ads, and Twitter Ads data are always transparent by design, regardless of the state of the Allow transparency toggle. This significantly reduces the volume of non-transparent traffic, which makes it much less valuable for marketers. Keeping your data transparent also enables you to make the most out of AppsFlyer's products. Note: If the marketer disables agency permissions, the agency's historical data (such as installs and cost) becomes non-transparent. Configuring transparency The transparency should be configured for each app separately. By default, your traffic is set to be transparent. To disable transparency: Go to Configuration > App Settings. Turn off Allow transparency.",
      "Note Only the account admins of agencies are able to change the transparency setting. Data from Facebook Ads, Twitter Ads, and SKAN remains transparent whether Allow transparencyis turned on or off. Agency Dashboard Click any app in the list of apps to access its dashboard. When you start running campaigns, the aggregate data attributed to you is displayed here. The Agency account dashboard includes default access to: Lifetime value overview dashboard In-app events dashboard Retargeting dashboard Running campaigns Self-reporting networks (SRNs) SRNs, also knows as Self-attributing networks (SANs), are networks that don\u2019t require AppsFlyer\u2019s attribution link in order to report clicks and other data, and use direct integration with AppsFlyer instead. Among these networks are Facebook, Twitter, Google Ads, Snapchat, DoubleClick, Apple Ads Search, Yahoo, and Yahoo! JAPAN. A majority of these networks require special setup for agencies. For example, since Facebook and Twitter integration can only be configured by an app owner,the agency campaign names MUST begin with the agency's name to make sure that the installs are eventually correctly attributed to the agency. Click the links above to read network guides and specific instructions for agency settings. Non-SRNs Most ad networks need attribution links that are placed behind an ad. Read more about running campaigns with them here. Owned media: Custom links and OneLink\u2122 If you run campaigns on media other than ad networks (social media, emails, blogs, SMS), you can use custom links for them. OneLink\u2122 is a type of a custom link, that allows you to use the same link for multiple platforms or send the users to specific content inside the app. Note: agencies cannot create OneLink or single-platform link templates, but they can use templates created by marketers. SKAdNetwork agency campaigns SKAdNetwork infrastructure, part of iOS by Apple, lets marketers measure campaign success without IDFA or advertising ID. Although Apple doesn't include agencies as part of the SKAdNetwork attribution process, and AppsFlyer can't attribute agencies directly, AppsFlyer still has the ability to provide attribution data for agency campaigns running on SKAdNetworks. Campaign naming To view your campaigns in the AppsFlyer SKAdNetwork dashboard, the names of campaigns that you configure with the SKAdNetwork, should include your partner identifier and be structured as follows: your af_prt (What's your af_prt and where to find it), underscore, your actual campaign name that follows your agency\u2019s naming convention. For example, if your af_prt is AgencyX, your campaign name may look like this: AgencyX_SummerSale Note Agency campaigns in SKAdNetwork are always transparent and the identity of the ad network running the campaign is not masked from the marketer. Consider that starting iOS 15, the marketer (app owner) can opt-in to directly receive a copy of the postback. You must ask the marketer to turn on the ad network Partner activation setting in the integration tab. If you don't do so, the ad network won't get postbacks related to SKAN campaigns. Note! This is in addition to the Partner activation setting that you can access in the user interface. Access to SKAN Conversion Studio Agencies can view and download amarketer's SKAN CV mapping configuration in Conversion Studio, but they can't configure or edit the settings. SKAdNetwork Dashboard Further reading: SKAdNetwork Quickstart guide SKAdNetwork Dashboard SKAdNetwork Solution Single Source of Truth (SSOT) for agencies SSOT unifies all attribution methods by combining attribution data from different models and removing duplicate installs and the associated cost and revenue-related metrics. This way,eCPI, ROI, and ROAS, for example, are calculated correctly. Agencies can access SSOT data in the Overview dashboard, but not via API. To include the SSOT flag in your overview dashboard, the marketer must turn on SSOT in the Conversion Studio.

      "At a glance: About sending events reported via Firebase SDK to AppsFlyer using Google Tag Manager.",
      "Related reading Overview (this article) Google Tag Manager (GTM) setup Sending events and installs using Firebase and GTM The AppsFlyer integration with Google Tag Manager (GTM) and Firebase allows the developer to send in-app events to Firebase using Firebase SDK, and to have the events sent to AppsFlyer via the SDK using Google Tag Manager. This avoids needing to send the same event twice. Events sent using GTM are modeled on AppsFlyer in-app events. The event name, parameters, and structure are the same. If you already have GTM in your app, using it to send events to AppsFlyer is straightforward. Use the steps and instructions in this guide to send events. Considerations Event source in raw data: Events generated by GTM have the source set to S2S in raw data reports. This can lead to some confusion as the events are reported by the SDK. Updating SKAdNetwork conversion value: Events generated by GTM and reported to the SDK as described in this guide cause the SDK to update the conversion value in a manner similar to regular SDK events. All that is required is that you turn on and set your SKAdNetwork measurement settings.",
      "Note Currently, the Google Tag Manager integration doesn't support sending the following parameters to AppsFlyer: Customer user ID att os Note that: When sending in-app event postbacks to SRNs, the att parameter is required. When sending in-app event postbacks to Facebook, the att and os parameters are required.",
      " Prerequisites Before you can start sending events to AppsFlyer using GTM, you need to implement GTM SDK in your app. You need: You need a GTM account. You need to have the GTM + Firebase integration setup for your app (instructions for Android and iOS). Integrate the AppsFlyer SDK if you haven't done so. Once everything is in place, proceed to GTM setup."

    "title": "GMP use case of traffic measurement from 3rd parties in CMP360 ",
    "answers": [
      "At a glance: Buy traffic from third-party media sources and measure mobile app conversions originating from this source in CM360. Google Marketing Platform CM360 & non-DV360 third-party media source for click and impression measurement Google Marketing Platform (GMP) brings together your advertising and analytics to help you make quality customer connections, surface deeper insights, and drive better marketing results. In the context of AppsFlyer, you can use AppsFlyer attribution links in DV360 to measure clicks and impressions. This requires the following: Integrate GMP in AppsFlyer. Retrieve the CM360 measurement link. This integration scenario requires standard CM360 tags as described here. Other types of tags are unsupported. Retrieve the AppsFlyer measurement link, in the integrated partner media source link. (3) Per Google\u2019s no-redirect policy, third-party links including OneLink are unsupported. Deep linking requires implementing relevant platform methods for iOS and Android. Append AppsFlyer link to CM360 link. Use the combined link in the media source. Considerations for agency attribution For CM360: For AppsFlyer to attribute an install to an agency, AppsFlyer must know the name of the agency. The name of the agency should be passed to AppsFlyer with the af_prt parameter found in the attribution link or via the referrer as part of the URL. Attribution link Because GMP is an SRN external attribution links aren't used by the campaigns they run. However, attribution links do play a role in the integration of GMP as detailed in the following scenario: Attribution links for CM360 & media source To run campaigns with CM360 and a media source, two attribution links are required: A CM360 measurement link. The AppsFlyer attribution link for a given media source (integrated partner or custom media source). See setting attribution links for CM360. Attribution links for DV360 AppsFlyer attribution links can be used in combination with DV360 for impression and click recording. These links aren't used for attribution. Additional information contained within them is not parsed or used for any other purpose. If you want to measure the number of clicks generated by DV360 in AppsFlyer, add an AppsFlyer attribution URL to your DV360 dashboard. When doing so, the campaign name in the attribution URL must be identical to that of the Placement ID on GMP (if possible) so that AppsFlyer can retrieve and append the click data to the correct campaigns. Using Attribution Links for GMP DV360 (DBM) is not mandatory. To count clicks in AppsFlyer, use the link that follows. https://app.appsflyer.com/ADD-APP-ID?pid=doubleclick_int&af_siteid=${UNIVERSAL_SITE_ID} &af_ad_id=${CREATIVE_ID}&c=${PLACEMENT_ID}&af_c_id=${PLACEMENT_ID} To count impressions, use the link that follows. https://impression.appsflyer.com/ADD-APP-ID?pid=doubleclick_int&af_siteid=%24{UNIVERSAL_SITE_ID} &af_ad_id=${CREATIVE_ID}&c=${PLACEMENT_ID}&af_c_id=${PLACEMENT_ID} Working with GMP CM360 and media sources Setting an attribution link for GMP campaign manager When setting up campaign management using CM360 and an AppsFlyer integrated partner, first complete the GMP Integration Guideand the partner's integration guide, before continuing with the instructions in this section. If you are managing a DV360 campaign through CM360, ignore the instructions in this section. Switch back to the integration tab and follow the instructions there. AppsFlyer does NOT recommend using the CM360 + media source scenario to report on SRN traffic, if the relevant SRN partner integration is also enabled. This is in order to avoid conflicts when reporting conversions from the same partner via two different integrations. For example, if the Facebook SRN integration is enabled in AppsFlyer, but CM360 is also utilized to report on Facebook traffic (facebook_int) using the method described in this article in parallel, conversions might alternatively be reported by Facebook and CM360, with CM360 capturing some of the conversions that would have been claimed by the main Facebook integration. Setting an attribution link for GMP campaign manager To run and measure campaigns in CM360, you need an AppsFlyer attribution link.For data to be posted back to GMP and correctly logged in AppsFlyer, such data needs to be appended on the AppsFlyer link and not the CM360 link. Create a CM360 link.You must make sure you have a placeholder for the Device ID, the parameter dc_rdid, because AppsFlyer only receives mobile app conversion claims from the GMP integration, based on the correct presence of this parameter. Create an attribution link. The attribution link should contain the actual media source that you intend to report on, which should be a third-party media source, not GMP. For example, if the third-party media source is Rocketfuel, use pid=rocketfuel_int and not pid=doubleclick_int. Learn more. Attribution link example: Android iOS https://app.appsflyer.com/com.example?pid=rocketfuel_int&c=campaign_name &advertising_id=13******-****-****-****-54********** https://app.appsflyer.com/com.example?pid=rocketfuel_int&c=campaign_name &idfa=13******-****-****-****-54**********",
      " Append the AppsFlyer attribution link to the CM360 link: Android iOS https://ad.doubleclick.net/ddm/trackclk/N736113.127733/B202683.204586115; dc_trk_aid=404426918;dc_trk_cid=92566356;dc_lat=;dc_rdid=13******-****-****-****-54********** ?https://app.appsflyer.com/com.example?pid=rocketfuel_int &c=campaign_name&advertising_id=13******-****-****-****-54********** https://ad.doubleclick.net/ddm/trackclk/N736113.127733/B202683.204586115; dc_trk_aid=404426918;dc_trk_cid=92566356;dc_lat=;dc_rdid=13******-****-****-****-54********** ?https://app.appsflyer.com/com.example?pid=rocketfuel_int &c=campaign_name&idfa=13******-****-****-****-54**********",
      " Using the attribution link Once you have the attribution link, make sure it is used while running ads on your intended media source. When an install occurs, AppsFlyer attributes the install to the selected media source. AppsFlyer then lets CM360 know about the install via the postback mechanism, using floodlight parameters used when configuring the integration. The end result is an install that is attributed to the media source, and an install that is registered in DCM360. Limitations Due to the Google no-redirect policy, third-party solutions such as OneLink cannot be relied on in the CM360 + media source scenario.Make sure to follow the Integration Guide before continuing with the instructions in this section."

      "At a glance: Attribute mobile app installs to ads viewed on CTV devices. CTV-to-mobile app attribution for ad networks With AppsFlyer cross-platform impression URLs, you can attribute mobile app installs to ads displayed on CTV. Multiple installs within the same household can be attributed to the same CTV ad impression. CTV-to-mobile app view-through attribution uses a OneLink impression URL based on a cross-platform OneLink template (with a template ID) created by the advertisers. This lets advertisers group multiple apps from different platforms (for example, both Android and iOS apps) using a single URL. When users view the ad on CTV, you send AppsFlyer the impression URL in real-time. Example URL: https://impressions.onelink.me/{template_id}?pid=__media_source__&af_xplatform=true&af_xplatform_vt_lookback=24h&af_siteid=__CSITE__&c=__CAMPAIGN_NAME__&af_channel=__PLACEMENT__&af_c_id=__CAMPAIGN_ID__&af_adset=__AID_NAME__&af_adset_id=__AID__&af_ad=__CID_NAME__&af_ad_id=__CID__&af_source_platform=__source_platform__&af_source_device_category=__device_category__&af_ad_type=__CTYPE__&af_ip=__IP__&af_ua=__UA__&redirect=false Postbacks are sent to you after each conversion. Setup To set up CTV-to-mobile app view-through attribution with an advertiser: Make sure you're an AppsFlyer integrated partner, that you have postbacks properly set up, and that you've tested your CTV-to-mobile app integration with AppsFlyer.

      "At a glance: Create and manage your ad network account's AppsFlyer users, and assign them a role defining which features they can access. Background AppsFlyer ad network accounts allow for multiple users, each with a role that defines their access to features and functions. The Admin role has access to all capabilities. The Marketing role has access to a more limited set of features. A full list of capabilities per role is available on the Roles tab of the User management page. More about roles As a general rule, all roles are predefined, and each role\u2019s functional capabilities are fixed: no \"mixing and matching\" allowed. However, you can change a user\u2019s functional capabilities at any time by changing their role (except for the account owner, as discussed below). Example You have assigned Bill Bates to the Marketing role. This role gives Bill the ability to manage Validation Rules but does not allow him access to the Audit log. Question: Can I keep Bill in the Marketing role but also give him the ability to access the Audit log? Can I take away his ability to manage Validation Rules? Answer: No. As long as Bill stays in the Marketing role, you cannot give him the ability to access the Audit log. Nor can you remove his ability to manage Validation Rules. Of course, you can assign Bill to a different role, and his capabilities will change to those defined by that role. Temp roles\u2014an exception to the rule If your AppsFlyer account existed under our prior user management system (when the only available account types were Admin and Team member), all users were brought into the new system with unchanged capabilities. As a result, most of these users appear in the current system with temp roles. Learn more about managing temp roles. Admin\u2014a special role An AppsFlyer account can have one or more Admins, but every account has at least one. This special role has several unique characteristics: The Admin role has access to all account features and functions. This \"all-access\" characteristic of the Admin role cannot be changed or limited. account owner hash The user created at the time the account was opened (the \"account owner\") is assigned the Admin role by default. The account owner cannot be deleted, removed from the Admin role, or otherwise edited from the User management page. Likewise, the account owner\u2019s email address cannot be changed. If you do need to change the account owner, follow the steps listed below. The account owner is initially responsible for creating additional users (until additional users with user management capabilities are created). Only the account owner can retrieve or reset the AppsFlyer API V1.0 token. Any Admin other than the account owner can be changed to a different role or deleted from the AppsFlyer account through the User management page. User management page To access the User management page: In the menu bar, click on the email address dropdown. Select User management.

    "title": "Attribution link specification for ad networks",
    "answers": [
      "At a glance: Ad networks integrating with AppsFlyer specify their attribution link according to this article. Attribution links for ad networks Attribution links are used to notify AppsFlyer that a user engaged with an ad by clicking it. In its simplest form, the attribution link is placed behindan ad so that when a user clicks on an ad they are clicking on an attribution link. Attribution model What happens on the journey from a first click or impression to the attribution of an install or an event\u2014and beyond. A user clicks on a banner or an offer link. The banner or link redirects the user to an AppsFlyer attribution link. The AppsFlyer attribution link is then populated with information that is collected during the click. We gather the information from the attribution link and store it in our database. An install occurs and the app is opened for the first time. The AppsFlyer SDK inside the app calls our servers with the information about the device that the app is installed on. We match this data to our click database using our Attribution methods: Referrer matchingThis attribution method is unique to Android devices. When a user clicks on a link and gets redirected to Google Play, Google Play gives it a unique Referrer ID. When the install takes place, we collect this ID from the device. Then we match it with Google Play records. Device ID matchingWe match the Device ID (IDFA for the iOS or GAID for the Android device) collected upon the click to the ID of the device that performs the install. Probabilistic modeling More about attribution methods. We look for the referrer, device ID, and probabilistic modeling data points (in that order) in our click database. If we find a match, we attribute the install to the click. If not, we attribute the install to an organic download. Once the install is attributed, we send a postback with the conversion details to the ad network. As it follows from this flow, we use attribution links to get information from you, and postbacks to send the information back to you. Note If you use third-party performance marketing tools such as TUNE, CAKE, or Affise, see platform-specific instructions. Attribution link template The attribution link (the link behind the banner/offer) can look like this: https://app.appsflyer.com/com.yourapp?pid=mediaName_int&clickid={clickid}&advertising_id={gaid}&af_siteid={affiliate_id}&af_cost_model=CPI&af_cost_value={cost_value}&af_cost_currency={currency}&c={Campaign}&af_ad_type={AdType}&af_adset={Adset}&af_ad={Ad}&is_incentivized={true\\false}&expires={timestamp}&signature={signature} https://app.appsflyer.com/ is the AppsFlyer endpoint, com.yourapp is App ID, and pid=mediaName_int is a unique media source name that we assign to your Ad Network. This part of the link is static and doesn\u2019t require anything from you. Link structure explanation: The values after \u2018=\u2019 inside {} are macros populated by you when the click takes place and gets sent to AppsFlyer. When you prepare your template, replace the value in brackets {} with your parameter names. Macro naming has no significance provided that your system replaces them with the actual and correct values. The parameters before the \u2018=\u2019 sign are placeholders used by AppsFlyer so we know which values you are sending us. To integrate with AppsFlyer, send us the attribution link template by email with your macro names. Regard the parameters listed in the table that follows as the recommended minimum.

      "At a glance: Add AppsFlyer to Windows/Xbox apps and games to measure app installs, in-app events, media sources, and more.",
      "Important! On March 1st, 2020, AppsFlyer deprecated old SDK versions. To learn about which versions have been deprecated, how it affects you, and how to update to the latest SDK version, click here. Current Version: 2.4.1 The AppsFlyer SDK provides app installation and event recording functionality. We have developed an SDK that is highly robust (8+ billion SDK installations to date), secure, lightweight, and very simple to embed. You can record installs, updates, and sessions (by following the mandatory steps below), and also record additional in-app events beyond app installs (including in-app purchases, game levels, etc.) to evaluate ROI and user engagement levels. Important! The AppsFlyer Windows SDK is compatible with all Universal Windows Platform (UWP) devices, including Windows mobile phones, Xbox, PC, HoloLens, and Surface hub. Universal Windows Platform SDK Download To download the Universal Windows Platform App SDK click here. 1. What's new in this version? New Event Parameter - CUSTOMER_SEGMENT Support for new Microsoft method to pass referrer Added a new section for C++ / CX Integration Bug fixes and maintenance 2. Initial steps The Windows Universal SDK is installed via the NuGet Package Manager. To install the AppsFlyer Windows SDK via Nuget: Right-click the project file. Click Manage NuGet Packages. Click Browse and search for AppsFlyerLib. Click the AppsFlyerLib. Click Install. If you choose to not use the NuGet package you can embed the AppsFlyer SDK into your app manually: Copy the AppsFlyerLib.winmd into your project. In Visual Studio, click Add Reference on the Universal Windows Platform project. Locate AppsFlyerLib.winmd and add it. Important! AppsFlyer uses a Newtonsoft.json package. This is a standard library for parsing Json in Windows. You can add this package using NuGet in Visual Studio. This solves the File Not Found exception in the DLL. In Visual Studio, right-click References and select NuGet Package Newtonsoft.json and add it. Allow Internet access in the app manifest, or use Visual Studio in the Capabilities tab. 3. SDK initialization & installation event (minimum requirement for attributing) Add the following code into your App Launch method. Set your appId and DevKey: Populate tracker.appId and tracker.devKey with your values. You can get your AppsFlyer DevKey on our dashboard under SDK Integration.",

In-app event recording API (optional) This API enables AppsFlyer to record post-install events. These events are defined by the advertiser and include an event name in addition to optional event values. Add the following code to record post-install events: public void TrackEvent(string eventName, IDictionary<string, Object> eventValues) eventName is any string that defines the event name. You can find a list of recommended event names here. eventValues is a dictionary of event parameters that comprise an event. You can find a list of recommended parameters here. When counting revenue as part of in-app events, use InAppEventParameterName.REVENUE (\u201caf_revenue\u201d) constant parameter name to count revenue as part of an in-app event. You can populate it with any numeric value, positive or negative. Example AppsFlyerLib.AppsFlyerTracker tracker = AppsFlyerLib.AppsFlyerTracker.GetAppsFlyerTracker(); IDictionary<string, object> eventValues = new Dictionary<string, object>(); eventValues.Add(AppsFlyerLib.AFInAppEventParameterName.CONTENT_ID, \"id123\"); eventValues.Add(AppsFlyerLib.AFInAppEventParameterName.REVENUE, \"10\"); eventValues.Add(AppsFlyerLib.AFInAppEventParameterName.CURRENCY, \"USD\"); tracker.TrackEvent(AppsFlyerLib.AFInAppEventType.ADD_TO_CART, eventValues); Recording events asynchronously You can record events asynchronously. This is useful in cases when the network is down or unresponsive. You can handle such cases in the Callback function that you pass to the TrackEventAsync method. tracker.TrackEventAsync(AppsFlyerLib.AFInAppEventType.PURCHASE, events, Callback); public void Callback(AppsFlyerLib.ServerStatusCode code) { if(code == AppsFlyerLib.ServerStatusCode.SUCCESS) { //success scenario } else if(code == AppsFlyerLib.ServerStatusCode.FAIL) { //failure scenario } } For a complete list of AppsFlyer rich in-app events, click here. 5. Advanced integration The following APIs are optional and are part of the advanced integration with AppsFlyer SDK. 5.1 set currency code (optional) You can set a global currency code using the API below, in addition to specific currency codes that can be used as part of each in-app event sent to AppsFlyer. USD is the default value. Acceptable ISO currency codes can be found here. Use the following API to set the currency code: tracker.currencyCode = \"GBP\"\u037e 5.2 getAppsFlyeruid (optional) An AppsFlyer Unique ID is created for every new install of an app. Use the following API In order to get this ID: public string getAppsFlyerUID() 5.3 Customer User ID (optional) Setting your own customer ID enables you to cross-reference your own unique ID with the AppsFlyer user ID and all other device IDs. This ID is available in the AppsFlyer CSV reports along with postbacks APIs for cross-referencing with your internal IDs. To set your Customer User ID: tracker.customerUserId = \"YOUR_CUSTOMER_USER_ID\"\u037e 5.4 GetConversionDataAsync (optional) You can receive the conversion data for every install through the SDK using this API. Add the following code to record post-install events: Task.Run(async () => { AppsFlyerLib.AppsFlyerTracker tracker = AppsFlyerLib.AppsFlyerTracker.GetAppsFlyerTracker(); string conversionData = await tracker.GetConversionDataAsync(); }); For more information about this advanced functionality, read here. 5.5 C++ / CX integration example AppsFlyerLib::AppsFlyerTracker^ tracker = AppsFlyerLib::AppsFlyerTracker::GetAppsFlyerTracker(); tracker->appId = ref new Platform::String(L\"APP_KEY\"); tracker->devKey = ref new Platform::String(L\"APPSFLYER_KEY\"); tracker->TrackAppLaunch(); create_task(tracker->GetConversionDataAsync()).then([tracker](Platform::String^ conversionData) { Windows::Foundation::Collections::IMap<Platform::String^, Platform::Object^>^ eventValues = ref new Platform::Collections::Map<Platform::String^, Platform::Object^>(); eventValues->Insert(AppsFlyerLib::AFInAppEventParameterName::CONTENT_ID, \"134\"); eventValues->Insert(AppsFlyerLib::AFInAppEventParameterName::CONTENT_TYPE, \"Virtual Goods\"); eventValues->Insert(AppsFlyerLib::AFInAppEventParameterName::CURRENCY, \"USD\"); eventValues->Insert(AppsFlyerLib::AFInAppEventParameterName::REVENUE, \"9.99\"); tracker->TrackEvent(AppsFlyerLib::AFInAppEventType::PURCHASE, eventValues); });"

Opt-in: after opting-out, resume data collection. The app developer and marketer, after considering the regulatory and business requirements, implement opt-in/opt-out as detailed in this article. Use opt-out to: Comply with regulations like GDPR and CCPA that prohibit or restrict data collection. Complete opt-out: stop collecting any attribution data. Partial opt-out:send some data or anonymize the data sent. Selective opt-out:based on specific regulations or age of the app user.",
      "Use opt-in: To switch opt-out to opt-in. Opting-out users Opt-out can take place at a number of different levels depending on regulatory and user requirements. Follow the appropriate flow using an opt-out scenario as detailed. Do this to ensure compliance with opt-out requests and in order to continue collecting attribution data where appropriate. In scenarios where opt-out is enabled, the AppsFlyer ID is hashed. Scenarios Opt-out at installation When: Upon the first launch (Example,COPPA compliance) What: The app requires the user's agreement to perform event recording during all sessions. If the user consents to recording (for example, user above a certain age) the app calls the SDK start method. Otherwise, the start method should not be called. Caution Don't use stop if start was never called. How: The start method should always be called at the session start of opted-in users, but shouldn't be called for opted-out users. In addition, in-app events cannot be sent for users who have never opted-in, as they are regarded as coming from unknown users and go to organic. Therefore, for apps, we recommend that enable Installation opt-out, has a permanent flag parameter that shows if start was called beforehand or not. This flag should ALWAYS be checked before calling start or logEvent methods are called. Data sent to AppsFlyer:No data is sent. If the user subsequently opts-in attribution and session data are sent from the time start is called. Example com.carefulapp requires users to register upon installing. The form includes a checkbox: \"I'm over age 13\". Dev the developer added a flag called is_tracking, which becomes true only for registrations that have this box checked, and then activates start. Code sample example here. Prevent data sharing with third parties When:Every time the SDK is initialized. What: A user can request to opt-out of sharing their data with 3rd parties. By activating this option in the AppsFlyer SDK BEFORE the first start call, the following applies to the whole session: Users from SRNs are attributed as Organic, and their data is not shared with integrated partners. Users from click ad networks (non-SRNs) are attributed correctly in AppsFlyer, but not shared with the ad networks via postbacks, APIs, raw data reports, or any other method. How: To prevent event data sharing via: SDK (Android, iOS\u2014starting with SDK V6.4+): Prevent one or more specified media sources (or all media sources) from receiving the event: Use setSharingFilterForPartnersSDK method. S2S API: Send the S2S sharing_filter parameter",
      "Data sent to AppsFlyer: Data is sent and stored in AppsFlyer, but never shared with AppsFlyer integrated partners. Example com.to.california is a travel app for California theme parks. To be CCPA compliant, if a resident of California submits an opt-out request, the app notifies AppsFlyer not to share the user event data with third-parties. Session opt-out When: On every app launch. What: All app sessions require user agreement to perform event and data recording during a session. How: For the Session opt-out scenario, the first SDK call comes after the user agrees or refuses that data be sent from their device: If the user agrees to send data, the start method should be called. If the user refuses that data be sent, don't call start. Data sent to AppsFlyer depends on the opt-out status of each session as follows: Opt-out session: No data is sent. Opt-in session: All session data is sent. Note: Attribution data is sent the first time the user opts-in.",
      "Example com.adultsplay is a casual gaming app for adults over 18 years old. It doesn't require users to register, but it does require their confirmation of age with every new launch. Sessions, where the users confirm they're over 18, get the full gaming experience and are recorded, while otherwise no recording is carried out. Dev the developer added a flag called is_tracking, which becomes true only for sessions that confirm age 18. If this flag is true, the start method is called. Otherwise, start isn't called. One-time opt-out When: Anytime (GDPR) What: The app owner collects attribution and post-install data. The user requests to stop further collection of data, for example, in compliance with a GDP request GDPR. How: Don't call start and then directly call stop! Instead, on the first launch use the start method with the requestListener. Upon successful completion, in the callback function call stop. On all the following sessions don't callstart. Data sent to AppsFlyer: Install and session data is sent to AppsFlyer. No data is sent to AppsFlyer after thestop method is called. Example com.watchmegrow is a plant growth viewing app, where users watch growing plants and mobile ads. The app owner wants to keep all in-app activities data secret. On the first launch, Dev the developer calls start method with the requestListener. When receiving a successful completion, calls stop from the callback function and sets a persistent parameter is_first_launch to false. On following launches, Dev checks if is_first_launch is false, and then skips start. Code sample example here Record install and anonymize When: Upon the first launch What: The app owner wants to collect all attribution data, and then wants to collect all subsequent information, such as in-app events or sessions data, as unattributed organic data. Post-installation, all device IDs are anonymized when sent to AppsFlyer from the SDK. How: Don't call start and then directly call stop! Instead, on the first launch use the start method with the requestListener. Upon successful completion, in the callback function call anonymizeUser(true). Data sent to AppsFlyer: On install:Complete attribution data is sent to AppsFlyer. After install: In-app events data and session data are sent to AppsFlyer without attribution data. Upon receipt, the user identifier is anonymized and the AppsFlyer ID and IP address are hashed. The following image shows an example of anonymized and hashed data. ",
      "Example The app owner of the com.munistic app believes all users are born equal and prefers to see all their post-install actions as organic only. On the first launch, Dev the developer calls start method with the requestListener. When receiving a successful completion, calls anonymizeUser(true) from the callback function. Code sample example here. Opting-out of retargeting campaigns Consider excluding opted-out users from retargeting campaigns. These users are likely to complain about being retargeted having opted out. When manually running retargeting campaigns, targeted at active users, make sure to remove the opted-out users from the lists sent to media sources lists. Alternately, if you're using AppsFlyer Audiences, to build your audience lists and send them to media sources, opted-out users are excluded from the lists sent to media sources. stop API and deep linking Using the stop API stops all external communication by the AppsFlyer SDK embedded in the app. Therefore, after calling stop, shortened links are no longer decoded by the AppsFlyer SDK. This means that any shortened link does not generate the call to onAppOpenAttribution, and deep linking isn't performed correctly. If your app has a relatively high percentage of opted-out users and you plan some retargeting campaigns for your users, use long links, and avoid using shortened links. Restarting the SDK function When an opted-out user agrees to opt-in call the start method to restart the SDK and begin recording attribution data. Strict mode SDK (iOS only) Sometimes developers prefer to submit their apps without any reference to the AdSupport framework and IDFA collection in their code. In such cases, use the Strict mode SDK."

      "Related reading For a complete picture of the AppsFlyer version control policy, be sure to read these articles: AppsFlyer version control policy (this article) AppsFlyer Android SDK release notes AppsFlyer iOS SDK release notes About versioning Throughout the years, AppsFlyer has released many versions of the SDK. Each SDK version calls a specific API version. The intent of the version control policy is to define how long an API will serve the SDK versions. Why do we need version control? The purpose of version control includes the following: Helps you understand in advance when an API for the SDK versions that are integrated into your apps will sunset. This is important because version adoption takes time, meaning it may take some time until your users upgrade to a newer app version. Improves stability (backward compatibility is for 2.5 years), thus eliminating unexpected errors when using very old SDK versions. Lets you take advantage of new features that require SDK upgrades. SDK version lifecycles An API version is guaranteed to run for 2.5 years. Whenever a new major or minor version of the SDK is released, AppsFlyer will set a sunset date for the previous minor version (including all of its patch versions). What happens when an SDK version is sunset? Once a version of the SDK is sunset, AppsFlyer servers will no longer measure installs, sessions, and in-app events. Events that reach these endpoints will simply be rejected. Since adoption takes time, it is highly recommended that your developer upgrade to the latest SDK version well in advance of the sunset date."

      "At a glance: Attribute mobile app installs to ads viewed on CTV devices. CTV-to-mobile app attribution for ad networks With AppsFlyer cross-platform impression URLs, you can attribute mobile app installs to ads displayed on CTV. Multiple installs within the same household can be attributed to the same CTV ad impression. CTV-to-mobile app view-through attribution uses a OneLink impression URL based on a cross-platform OneLink template (with a template ID) created by the advertisers. This lets advertisers group multiple apps from different platforms (for example, both Android and iOS apps) using a single URL. When users view the ad on CTV, you send AppsFlyer the impression URL in real-time. Example URL: https://impressions.onelink.me/{template_id}?pid=__media_source__&af_xplatform=true&af_xplatform_vt_lookback=24h&af_siteid=__CSITE__&c=__CAMPAIGN_NAME__&af_channel=__PLACEMENT__&af_c_id=__CAMPAIGN_ID__&af_adset=__AID_NAME__&af_adset_id=__AID__&af_ad=__CID_NAME__&af_ad_id=__CID__&af_source_platform=__source_platform__&af_source_device_category=__device_category__&af_ad_type=__CTYPE__&af_ip=__IP__&af_ua=__UA__&redirect=false Postbacks are sent to you after each conversion.

      "At a glance: Create and manage your ad network account's AppsFlyer users, and assign them a role defining which features they can access. Background AppsFlyer ad network accounts allow for multiple users, each with a role that defines their access to features and functions. The Admin role has access to all capabilities. The Marketing role has access to a more limited set of features. A full list of capabilities per role is available on the Roles tab of the User management page. More about roles As a general rule, all roles are predefined, and each role\u2019s functional capabilities are fixed: no \"mixing and matching\" allowed. However, you can change a user\u2019s functional capabilities at any time by changing their role (except for the account owner, as discussed below). Example You have assigned Bill Bates to the Marketing role. This role gives Bill the ability to manage Validation Rules but does not allow him access to the Audit log. Question: Can I keep Bill in the Marketing role but also give him the ability to access the Audit log? Can I take away his ability to manage Validation Rules? Answer: No. As long as Bill stays in the Marketing role, you cannot give him the ability to access the Audit log. Nor can you remove his ability to manage Validation Rules. Of course, you can assign Bill to a different role, and his capabilities will change to those defined by that role. Temp roles\u2014an exception to the rule If your AppsFlyer account existed under our prior user management system (when the only available account types were Admin and Team member), all users were brought into the new system with unchanged capabilities. As a result, most of these users appear in the current system with temp roles. Learn more about managing temp roles. Admin\u2014a special role An AppsFlyer account can have one or more Admins, but every account has at least one. This special role has several unique characteristics: The Admin role has access to all account features and functions. This \"all-access\" characteristic of the Admin role cannot be changed or limited. account owner hash The user created at the time the account was opened (the \"account owner\") is assigned the Admin role by default. The account owner cannot be deleted, removed from the Admin role, or otherwise edited from the User management page. Likewise, the account owner\u2019s email address cannot be changed. If you do need to change the account owner, follow the steps listed below. The account owner is initially responsible for creating additional users (until additional users with user management capabilities are created). Only the account owner can retrieve or reset the AppsFlyer API V1.0 token. Any Admin other than the account owner can be changed to a different role or deleted from the AppsFlyer account through the User management page. User management page To access the User management page: In the menu bar, click on the email address dropdown. Select User management.

    "title": "Attribution link specification for ad networks",
    "answers": [
      "At a glance: Ad networks integrating with AppsFlyer specify their attribution link according to this article. Attribution links for ad networks Attribution links are used to notify AppsFlyer that a user engaged with an ad by clicking it. In its simplest form, the attribution link is placed behindan ad so that when a user clicks on an ad they are clicking on an attribution link. Attribution model What happens on the journey from a first click or impression to the attribution of an install or an event\u2014and beyond. A user clicks on a banner or an offer link. The banner or link redirects the user to an AppsFlyer attribution link. The AppsFlyer attribution link is then populated with information that is collected during the click. We gather the information from the attribution link and store it in our database. An install occurs and the app is opened for the first time. The AppsFlyer SDK inside the app calls our servers with the information about the device that the app is installed on. We match this data to our click database using our Attribution methods: Referrer matchingThis attribution method is unique to Android devices. When a user clicks on a link and gets redirected to Google Play, Google Play gives it a unique Referrer ID. When the install takes place, we collect this ID from the device. Then we match it with Google Play records. Device ID matchingWe match the Device ID (IDFA for the iOS or GAID for the Android device) collected upon the click to the ID of the device that performs the install. Probabilistic modeling More about attribution methods. We look for the referrer, device ID, and probabilistic modeling data points (in that order) in our click database. If we find a match, we attribute the install to the click. If not, we attribute the install to an organic download. Once the install is attributed, we send a postback with the conversion details to the ad network. As it follows from this flow, we use attribution links to get information from you, and postbacks to send the information back to you. Note If you use third-party performance marketing tools such as TUNE, CAKE, or Affise, see platform-specific instructions. Attribution link template The attribution link (the link behind the banner/offer) can look like this: https://app.appsflyer.com/com.yourapp?pid=mediaName_int&clickid={clickid}&advertising_id={gaid}&af_siteid={affiliate_id}&af_cost_model=CPI&af_cost_value={cost_value}&af_cost_currency={currency}&c={Campaign}&af_ad_type={AdType}&af_adset={Adset}&af_ad={Ad}&is_incentivized={true\\false}&expires={timestamp}&signature={signature} https://app.appsflyer.com/ is the AppsFlyer endpoint, com.yourapp is App ID, and pid=mediaName_int is a unique media source name that we assign to your Ad Network. This part of the link is static and doesn\u2019t require anything from you. Link structure explanation: The values after \u2018=\u2019 inside {} are macros populated by you when the click takes place and gets sent to AppsFlyer. When you prepare your template, replace the value in brackets {} with your parameter names. Macro naming has no significance provided that your system replaces them with the actual and correct values. The parameters before the \u2018=\u2019 sign are placeholders used by AppsFlyer so we know which values you are sending us. To integrate with AppsFlyer, send us the attribution link template by email with your macro names. Regard the parameters listed in the table that follows as the recommended minimum. We support a larger set of parameters. You should share with us as much information on the click as you collect. See the list of attribution link parameters.

      "Important! On March 1st, 2020, AppsFlyer deprecated old SDK versions. To learn about which versions have been deprecated, how it affects you, and how to update to the latest SDK version, click here. Current Version: 2.4.1 The AppsFlyer SDK provides app installation and event recording functionality. We have developed an SDK that is highly robust (8+ billion SDK installations to date), secure, lightweight, and very simple to embed. You can record installs, updates, and sessions (by following the mandatory steps below), and also record additional in-app events beyond app installs (including in-app purchases, game levels, etc.) to evaluate ROI and user engagement levels. Important! The AppsFlyer Windows SDK is compatible with all Universal Windows Platform (UWP) devices, including Windows mobile phones, Xbox, PC, HoloLens, and Surface hub. Universal Windows Platform SDK Download To download the Universal Windows Platform App SDK click here. 1. What's new in this version? New Event Parameter - CUSTOMER_SEGMENT Support for new Microsoft method to pass referrer Added a new section for C++ / CX Integration Bug fixes and maintenance 2. Initial steps The Windows Universal SDK is installed via the NuGet Package Manager. To install the AppsFlyer Windows SDK via Nuget: Right-click the project file. Click Manage NuGet Packages. Click Browse and search for AppsFlyerLib. Click the AppsFlyerLib. Click Install. If you choose to not use the NuGet package you can embed the AppsFlyer SDK into your app manually: Copy the AppsFlyerLib.winmd into your project. In Visual Studio, click Add Reference on the Universal Windows Platform project. Locate AppsFlyerLib.winmd and add it. Important! AppsFlyer uses a Newtonsoft.json package. This is a standard library for parsing Json in Windows. You can add this package using NuGet in Visual Studio. This solves the File Not Found exception in the DLL. In Visual Studio, right-click References and select NuGet Package Newtonsoft.json and add it. Allow Internet access in the app manifest, or use Visual Studio in the Capabilities tab. 3.

Opt-in: after opting-out, resume data collection. The app developer and marketer, after considering the regulatory and business requirements, implement opt-in/opt-out as detailed in this article. Use opt-out to: Comply with regulations like GDPR and CCPA that prohibit or restrict data collection. Complete opt-out: stop collecting any attribution data. Partial opt-out:send some data or anonymize the data sent. Selective opt-out:based on specific regulations or age of the app user.",
      "Use opt-in: To switch opt-out to opt-in. Opting-out users Opt-out can take place at a number of different levels depending on regulatory and user requirements. Follow the appropriate flow using an opt-out scenario as detailed. Do this to ensure compliance with opt-out requests and in order to continue collecting attribution data where appropriate. In scenarios where opt-out is enabled, the AppsFlyer ID is hashed. Scenarios Opt-out at installation When: Upon the first launch (Example,COPPA compliance) What: The app requires the user's agreement to perform event recording during all sessions. If the user consents to recording (for example, user above a certain age) the app calls the SDK start method. Otherwise, the start method should not be called. Caution Don't use stop if start was never called. How: The start method should always be called at the session start of opted-in users, but shouldn't be called for opted-out users. In addition, in-app events cannot be sent for users who have never opted-in, as they are regarded as coming from unknown users and go to organic. Therefore, for apps, we recommend that enable Installation opt-out, has a permanent flag parameter that shows if start was called beforehand or not. This flag should ALWAYS be checked before calling start or logEvent methods are called. Data sent to AppsFlyer:No data is sent. If the user subsequently opts-in attribution and session data are sent from the time start is called. Example com.carefulapp requires users to register upon installing. The form includes a checkbox: \"I'm over age 13\". Dev the developer added a flag called is_tracking, which becomes true only for registrations that have this box checked, and then activates start. Code sample example here. Prevent data sharing with third parties When:Every time the SDK is initialized. What: A user can request to opt-out of sharing their data with 3rd parties. By activating this option in the AppsFlyer SDK BEFORE the first start call, the following applies to the whole session: Users from SRNs are attributed as Organic, and their data is not shared with integrated partners. Users from click ad networks (non-SRNs) are attributed correctly in AppsFlyer, but not shared with the ad networks via postbacks, APIs, raw data reports, or any other method. How: To prevent event data sharing via: SDK (Android, iOS\u2014starting with SDK V6.4+): Prevent one or more specified media sources (or all media sources) from receiving the event: Use setSharingFilterForPartnersSDK method. S2S API: Send the S2S sharing_filter parameter",
      "Data sent to AppsFlyer: Data is sent and stored in AppsFlyer, but never shared with AppsFlyer integrated partners. Example com.to.california is a travel app for California theme parks. To be CCPA compliant, if a resident of California submits an opt-out request, the app notifies AppsFlyer not to share the user event data with third-parties. Session opt-out When: On every app launch. What: All app sessions require user agreement to perform event and data recording during a session. How: For the Session opt-out scenario, the first SDK call comes after the user agrees or refuses that data be sent from their device: If the user agrees to send data, the start method should be called. If the user refuses that data be sent, don't call start. Data sent to AppsFlyer depends on the opt-out status of each session as follows: Opt-out session: No data is sent. Opt-in session: All session data is sent. Note: Attribution data is sent the first time the user opts-in.",
      "Example com.adultsplay is a casual gaming app for adults over 18 years old. It doesn't require users to register, but it does require their confirmation of age with every new launch. Sessions, where the users confirm they're over 18, get the full gaming experience and are recorded, while otherwise no recording is carried out. Dev the developer added a flag called is_tracking, which becomes true only for sessions that confirm age 18. If this flag is true, the start method is called. Otherwise, start isn't called. One-time opt-out When: Anytime (GDPR) What: The app owner collects attribution and post-install data. The user requests to stop further collection of data, for example, in compliance with a GDP request GDPR. How: Don't call start and then directly call stop! Instead, on the first launch use the start method with the requestListener. Upon successful completion, in the callback function call stop. On all the following sessions don't callstart. Data sent to AppsFlyer: Install and session data is sent to AppsFlyer. No data is sent to AppsFlyer after thestop method is called. Example com.watchmegrow is a plant growth viewing app, where users watch growing plants and mobile ads. The app owner wants to keep all in-app activities data secret. On the first launch, Dev the developer calls start method with the requestListener. When receiving a successful completion, calls stop from the callback function and sets a persistent parameter is_first_launch to false. On following launches, Dev checks if is_first_launch is false, and then skips start. Code sample example here Record install and anonymize When: Upon the first launch What: The app owner wants to collect all attribution data, and then wants to collect all subsequent information, such as in-app events or sessions data, as unattributed organic data. Post-installation, all device IDs are anonymized when sent to AppsFlyer from the SDK. How: Don't call start and then directly call stop! Instead, on the first launch use the start method with the requestListener. Upon successful completion, in the callback function call anonymizeUser(true). Data sent to AppsFlyer: On install:Complete attribution data is sent to AppsFlyer. After install: In-app events data and session data are sent to AppsFlyer without attribution data. Upon receipt, the user identifier is anonymized and the AppsFlyer ID and IP address are hashed. The following image shows an example of anonymized and hashed data. ",
      "Example The app owner of the com.munistic app believes all users are born equal and prefers to see all their post-install actions as organic only. On the first launch, Dev the developer calls start method with the requestListener. When receiving a successful completion, calls anonymizeUser(true) from the callback function. Code sample example here. Opting-out of retargeting campaigns Consider excluding opted-out users from retargeting campaigns. These users are likely to complain about being retargeted having opted out. When manually running retargeting campaigns, targeted at active users, make sure to remove the opted-out users from the lists sent to media sources lists. Alternately, if you're using AppsFlyer Audiences, to build your audience lists and send them to media sources, opted-out users are excluded from the lists sent to media sources. stop API and deep linking Using the stop API stops all external communication by the AppsFlyer SDK embedded in the app. Therefore, after calling stop, shortened links are no longer decoded by the AppsFlyer SDK. This means that any shortened link does not generate the call to onAppOpenAttribution, and deep linking isn't performed correctly. If your app has a relatively high percentage of opted-out users and you plan some retargeting campaigns for your users, use long links, and avoid using shortened links. Restarting the SDK function When an opted-out user agrees to opt-in call the start method to restart the SDK and begin recording attribution data. Strict mode SDK (iOS only) Sometimes developers prefer to submit their apps without any reference to the AdSupport framework and IDFA collection in their code. In such cases, use the Strict mode SDK."

      "Related reading For a complete picture of the AppsFlyer version control policy, be sure to read these articles: AppsFlyer version control policy (this article) AppsFlyer Android SDK release notes AppsFlyer iOS SDK release notes About versioning Throughout the years, AppsFlyer has released many versions of the SDK. Each SDK version calls a specific API version. The intent of the version control policy is to define how long an API will serve the SDK versions. Why do we need version control? The purpose of version control includes the following: Helps you understand in advance when an API for the SDK versions that are integrated into your apps will sunset. This is important because version adoption takes time, meaning it may take some time until your users upgrade to a newer app version. Improves stability (backward compatibility is for 2.5 years), thus eliminating unexpected errors when using very old SDK versions. Lets you take advantage of new features that require SDK upgrades. SDK version lifecycles An API version is guaranteed to run for 2.5 years. Whenever a new major or minor version of the SDK is released, AppsFlyer will set a sunset date for the previous minor version (including all of its patch versions). What happens when an SDK version is sunset? Once a version of the SDK is sunset, AppsFlyer servers will no longer measure installs, sessions, and in-app events. Events that reach these endpoints will simply be rejected. Since adoption takes time, it is highly recommended that your developer upgrade to the latest SDK version well in advance of the sunset date."

Conversion and standard event data are available inraw data reports. Conversion events Conversion events provide insights into your marketing and business efforts. Conversion events include purchases, downloads, signups, and subscriptions. PBA attributes conversion events to the media source that drove the user to visit the website. By identifying the attributed media source, you can measure and differentiate the quality of users brought by different media sources. Conversion events are used to record revenue and calculate ROI. Use them to compare the budget of ads for specific media sources against the revenue generated from the users that come from these media sources. Standard events Standard events are used to validate the user journey and funnels that lead to conversions. Use them to measure user activity and highlight media sources that bring engaged users.

      "Related reading For a complete picture of working with Snapchat in AppsFlyer, check out these articles: Snapchat integration setup guide Snapchat marketing partners setup Snapchat integration discrepancies (this article) Snapchat and AppsFlyer SKAdNetwork interoperation In certain instances, advertisers can see fewer installs on AppsFlyer dashboard than on the Snapchat Ads Manager dashboard. Sometimes, the discrepancy can be addressed by making changes to the settings in the AppsFlyer dashboard or Snapchat Ads Manager (e.g timezone settings, attribution windows etc.). However, a discrepancy between the two dashboards is expected. Advertisers should rely on the AppsFlyer dashboard as the source of truth when evaluating CPI and performance. Advertisers should be aware of the following causes and consider taking the necessary actions. Source of discrepancies and solutions Set out below are a number of causes of discrepancies and possible solutions. Different lookback windows By default, Snapchat Ads Manager and AppsFlyer have different attribution windows.",

      " Solutions Configure the attribution window in AppsFlyer to match Snapchat\u2019s default values. Advertisers can select attribution windows in the Ads Manager dashboard to match what they have set as default in their attribution partner (MMP) dashboard. Contact your Snapchat CSM to have your account allowlisted to activate this feature. Time zone differences By default, Ads Manager uses PST timezone whereas AppsFlyer uses UTC +0 by default. As a result, for example, Snapchat might attribute an install to Friday while AppsFlyer attributes it to Saturday. Solution Configure PST as the timezone for each app in AppsFlyer. Click here for details of how to change the time zone for existing apps. Multi-channel source attribution A user might engage with an ad for the same app on multiple platforms, especially with very large multi-platform campaigns. When the user installs the app, multiple platforms may take credit for the install. Snapchat Ads Manager: Counts each install occurring within the attribution window as an install attributed to Snapchat. Attributes in-app events up to 28 days after install. AppsFlyer: Applies last touch attribution and credits only the last platform to show the user an ad that led to an install. Attributes in-app events to the source of the install up to 180 days. This can lead to discrepancies as high as 40% between AppsFlyer and Snapchat Ads Manager. Solution Snapchat is just one mobile application, whereas other platforms own multiple mobile applications or mobile ad networks/exchanges. Due to their additional reach across multiple properties, it is possible that competitors might win the last touch, yet Snapchat is still driving significant value. Ultimately, AppsFlyer should be the dashboard used to evaluate eCPI and performance. When there is a discrepancy, default to AppsFlyer as the source of truth. Keep in mind that to fully evaluate the impact of your Snapchat campaigns, you should work with AppsFlyer to keep a record of the volume of conversions where Snapchat was a contributor to the conversion but was not the last touch. There is value to understanding this even if you attribute based on the last touch. To manage the discrepancy, advertisers should keep records of the approximate percentage of total conversions for which Snapchat was a contributor but not the last contributor and as such create a new eCPI goal for Snapchat based on this approximate delta."

Since 2016, there are considerable built-in OS limitations to using URI schemes as a fallback method for when iOS Universal Links don't open the app. These limitations are not AppsFlyer-related, and would also impact any other links with URI schemes you might use to open the app. By default, URI schemes (carried as the value of the af_dp param) are only used as a fallback method for opening the app on iOS on a few specific browsers/platforms. For Safari, you can try to use URI schemes as a fallback to open apps on iOS by setting the following parameters on your OneLink URL: af_dp (that carries the URI scheme as the value). af_force_deeplink=true (that forces the app to open using the af_dp URI scheme). Without this parameter, the app doesn't open using the URI scheme. For other browsers, URI schemes are unpredictable and therefore, not supported by default. Users clicking the link are likely to be redirected to the App Store (or if set, to the URL set on the af_ios_urlparam). See the scenarios flowchart and use cases that follow for additional details. Scenarios flowchart Use cases Browsers that can use URI schemes by default Sometimes, Universal Links fail to open the app, either because the app does not exist, or the link does not have Universal Links configured.

Introduction As of April 2022, app developers will be required to provide information related to their privacy practices through the Google dedicated safety section. Specifically, app developers will need to provide details on the data they collect, how it is handled and shared, including through their use of any third-party SDKs. The information provided by each app will be displayed in the Google store listing helping end-users better understand an app\u2019s privacy practices. Audience All app developers will be required to complete the safety section questionnaire and publish a link to a privacy policy even if they do not collect any of the data types specified by Google. Google safety form (questionnaire) Google has published a form (questionnaire) that app developers will be required to complete. The questionnaire includes the following sections: Data collection and security Data types Data usage and handling App developers will need to first assess their data collection and handling practices before responding to the questionnaire. With respect to the use of AppsFlyer, app developers are reminded that they have full control over how they implement and configure AppsFlyer, including the data collected and how it is used. Therefore, each app developer may have different answers to the questionnaire based on their data practices and use of AppsFlyer. App developers must respond to the questionnaire in accordance with their specific use cases, configurations, and partner integrations. Data collection and security In this section, you will be asked a few general yes/no questions: Does your app collect or share any of the required data types? Is all of the user data collected by your app encrypted in transit? Do you provide a way for users to request that their data be deleted? With respect to your use of AppsFlyer, AppsFlyer encrypts all data in transit that is transmitted through the SDK. AppsFlyer also provides customers with the ability to delete specific end-user data through its OpenGDPR framework. For the data types collected, see the table in the Data types section. Data types In this section, you will be asked to select the data types collected and respond to the following: If the data is shared Is the data processed ephemerally Is the data required or can end-users opt-out The purpose The following table assumes AppsFlyer software default configurations.

      "At a glance: Measure the quality of your users throughout their user journey by recording these suggested in-app events for your peer-to-peer (P2P) lending app. P2P lending P2P lending is a way for individuals and businesses to lend and borrow money from one another. The typical events that we suggest recording are the activities of individual lenders and borrowers, the types of loans people offer, and loan acceptance and rejection rates. The data that you gather from event recording can highlight trustworthy borrowers and offer them better interest rates. Similarly, you can see who the most active lenders are and offer them lower fees. In addition, once you know what type of loans are most popular with your users, you can launch marketing campaigns that target these audiences. Important! Make sure to read the instructions for marketers about implementing in-app events. To streamline the implementation process, use our In-app event generator. This tool includes all of the typical in-app events described in this article and lets you modify the events according to your business needs. Once complete, share the file with your developer. For each recommended event included in this article, there are code samples for iOS, Android, and Unity developers. Detailed instructions for your developer can be found in the AppsFlyer developer hub. For more information about recording in-app events, see the Rich in-app events guide.

    "title": "SparkPost integration with AppsFlyer",
    "answers": [
      "At a glance: Learn how to embed AppsFlyer OneLink in SparkPost, an email delivery and analytics platform. Email service providers (ESPs) are excellent sources of segmented user traffic. They wrap deep linking URLs with their own click recording domain. In some cases doing so breaks iOS Universal Links. To overcome this, SparkPost uses Universal Links on top of their click recording domain. They integrate with AppsFlyer and by using OneLink capabilities enable deep linking and click recording. Setting up SparkPost Configure SparkPost and the AppsFlyer SDK, to send emails containing OneLinks. For additional information on setting up SparkPost, reach out to SparkPost support. Prerequisite Mobile SDK versions: iOS: V6.0.4 or later Android V6.0.0 or later Step 1: Setting in SparkPost Create a dedicated click tracking domain and set a subdomain.Example: click.example.com. Set up sending domains and click-tracking domains, and enable HTTP engagement tracking. Related reading getting started with SparkPost. To set up domains and HTTP engagement tracking: Open your SparkPost dashboard. Go to Configuration > Sending Domains. Click Add a Domain. Follow the instructions in the user interface. Go to Configuration > Tracking Domains. Click Create Tracking Domain. Follow the instructions in the user interface. To enable HTTPS engagement tracking: Follow SparkPost instructions about enabling SSL for the tracking domain. Step 2: AASA hosting and custom link sub-path setup For SparkPost to support iOS Universal Links, you need to upload an AASA file onto it. When you set up OneLink with Universal Links, you already have an AASA associated with the OneLink. To get the AASA: In AppsFlyer, go to OneLink templates. Copy a OneLink that is configured with Universal Links. Add /.well-known/apple-app-site-associationto the end of the OneLink URL.Example: <OneLinkSubdomain>.onelink.me/.well-known/apple-app-site-association. Paste the OneLink in the browser address bar, then <enter>.The AASA file downloads to your computer. Follow SparkPost guide on how to configure Universal Links and create custom link sub-path. Host the AASA in your click recording domain server in SparkPost. Host the file in the path: click.example.com/.well-known/apple-app-site-association. After the click tracking domain is verified: Delete the cname definition (example: example click -> spgo.io). Cname your click tracking domain to your CDN (where the AASA file is located).",
      " Important! Once the AASA file is hosted, any modification or replacement of your OneLink configuration requires generating a new AASA file. Step 3: Configure AppsFlyer SDK Before configuring the AppsFlyer SDK, configure the app to support deep linking with OneLink. Associate click recording domain in Xcode In Xcode, select your project. Select Capabilities. Turn on Associated Domains. Click + (plus), enter your click domain. For example, applinks:click.example.com. Resolve deep links To get campaign details, the SDK needs to resolve the OneLink behind the click domain. The details are returned in the onAppOpenAttribution method.To resolve click domains: List the click domains in the SDK property resolveDeepLinkURLs.Make sure to set this property before SDK initialization. Define spgo.io as part of resolving deeplink API.SparkPost owns this domain and its part of the redirection flow.",
      "Example AppsFlyerLib.shared().resolveDeepLinkURLs = [\u201cclick.example.com\u201d,\u201cspgo.io\u201d] When a click on the Universal Link occurs, the app is invoked. AppsFlyer SDK resolves the deep link and extracts the underlying OneLink. Then, all deep link parameters are propagated into the onAppOpenAttribution API for deep link logic execution.Learn more about resolving wrapped deep link URLs. Send emails with OneLink through SparkPost Create a OneLink URL on the Link Management page (or manually). You must URL-encode parameter values. [Best practice] Use the following parameters: pid (media source): Use a media source that signifies this usage such as Email. c (campaign): Campaign name af_dp: The deep link URI scheme you want to deep-link your users into. af_web_dp: Where to redirect users clicking the link on desktop. af_ios_url: Where to redirect users that don\u2019t have the app clicking the link on an iOS device. af_android_url: Where to redirect users that don\u2019t have the app click the link on an Android device. Insert the OneLink URL in the email created using the SparkPost Code Editor or Design Editor. Example: <a href=\"links.example.com data-msys-sublink=\"appsflyer\">Link to your app!</a> If the email is part of a retargeting campaign, add the parameter is_retargeting=true.This indicates that the attribution link is from a retargeting campaign. Learn more about retargeting. SparkPost wraps the link with the defined click domain so that a click on the click domain redirects to the OneLink attribution link.",

Retargeting fundamentals Retargeting attribution occurs when a user engages with a retargeting campaign by clicking on a retargeting attribution link or deep link. This results in one of the following attribution events: Re-engagement: If the app is on the device, the media source motivating the user to open the app is credited with a re-engagement. Re-attribution (AKA retargeting reinstall): If the app is not on the user device (meaning the user uninstalled the app), then engaging with the retargeting campaign causes the user to reinstall and open the app. If this happens during a re-attribution window: the retargeting media source is credited with the re-attribution.

For ease of understanding, you should be familiar with the AppsFlyerattribution model and the associated attribution windows. Re-engagement rules and windows Retargeting attribution rules determine if an event is a retargeting event and attributed to the retargeting media source. Similar to user acquisition attribution campaigns, SRN retargeting re-engagements are reported by API and those of non-SRNs by attribution link. The rules, based on the user journey, consist of : Inclusion windows, a period of time during which a re-engagement can take place. Exclusion windows, a period of time during which a re-engagement can't take place. If a re-engagement is attributed, in-app events for the duration of the re-engagement window are double attributed. This means it's attributed to both the retargeting media source and to the original UA media source, if known. The diagram that follows contains the set of re-engagement rules.

API overview The Audiences Additional Identifiers API can be used to add the following user identifiers from your internal systems to AppsFlyer Audiences: Up to 2 hashed email addresses Hashed telephone number Hashed E164 telephone number You can then choose to send these identifiers to your Audiences partners (subject to your account-level user identifier policy), allowing them to more accurately identify your target audiences. Note that not all advertising partners support all identifiers. When should I use this API? This API was designed to be used when you want to upload a large volume of identifier data. Typically, this means data collected over time (for example, hashed emails collected from all users of an app over the last 12 months). For real-time, individual updates of identifiers from specific devices, configure additional identifiers in the AppsFlyer SDK or S2S-mobile API. Important! Encryption: All additional identifier values must be encrypted with SHA256 hashing. Unencrypted identifiers will not be processed. Timing: To ensure accurate matching of identifiers, the Audiences Additional Identifiers API can be used as soon as the day following the reporting of key identifiers through the AppsFlyer SDK (UTC). For example, key identifiers reported on 3-January-2022 (UTC) can be updated through this API on 4-January-2022 (UTC) or later. Methods Add/modify identifiers (PUT) Remove identifiers (DELETE) Authentication The request must include an HTTP header containing your account's AppsFlyer V2.0 API token.

The purpose of the SDK is to pull all the required data to dynamically display the Smart Banners. The Smart Banners SDK also automatically builds the proper attribution links, so you don't need to build them manually. Therefore, theSmart Banner SDK should be accessible from all pages displaying your mobile banners. The Smart Banner SDK authenticates using the unique Web key, which you can get from the Website workplace. Code snippet Note Starting January 1st, 2020 the SDK for Smart Bannerslets you use both Smart Bannersand People-based Attribution on your website. The SDK snippets below contain two examples: Using the Web SDK for Smart Banners only. Using the Web SDK for both Smart Banners and People-based Attribution.

Note: Don't use this function when implementing Smart Banners in a wrapper/hybrid app to load the banner page from the app (and not from the browser), as using showBanner will display the banner within the app. If you do use showBanner for a wrapper/hybrid app, use hideBanner for mobile app loads. Parameters (optional): bannerContainerQueryIf passed, the SDK tries to locate an element in the page with this query and treats it as the entry point for the banner placement. Otherwise, document.bodyis used. bannerZIndexSmart Banners are by default set to the max z-index value, so they won't be hidden by the website elements. This can be changed if you want some website components to be on top of the banner. additionalParamsIf passed, these parameters (for example, deep_link_value) are added as query parameters to the OneLink URL. Example: New SDK Old SDK - deprecated AF('banners', 'showBanner', { bannerContainerQuery: \"#container-id\", bannerZIndex: 1000,  additionalParams: { p1: \"v1\", p2: \"v2\"...}}); showBanner({ bannerContainerQuery: \"#container-id\", bannerZIndex: 1000, additionalParams: { p1: \"v1\", p2: \"v2\"...}});",

      "Example AF (\"banners\", \"updateParams\", {p1: \"v1\", p2: \"v2\"...}) Considerations The parameters are added as query parameters to the OneLink URL. When you use updateParams to add parameters, the impression URL is different than the click URL. Parameters added don\u2019t replace those on the original OneLink URL. If the parameter you add is already in the OneLink URL, it doesn\u2019t change. If updateParams is called more than once, only the parameters from the last call are added to the URL.

The parameters are appended on the OneLink URL behind the banner. Parameters ParamsMap of key/value parameters that can override any pre-existing attribution link parameters (besides the pid value). Usage example You want to differentiate between landing pages using specific parameters. To do so, you can append additional parameters to the OneLink behind the banner. When a user installs your app after clicking the banner, the parameters on the OneLink appear in the raw data for you to analyze. The code example below makes use of the af_sub1 parameter. // call this method before calling showBanner() setAdditionalParameters('af_sub': 'custom_paramter_value') The format of the final OneLink is this: subdomain.onelink.me/onelink-id?pid=af_banner&c=campaign&af_sub1=custom_paramter_value. The subdomain and OneLink ID are taken from the OneLink template. For example: ab12.onelink.me/xyz1?pid=af_banner&c=summer_campaign&af_sub1=uk_landing_page. You can use any valid parameter. For more information on attribution link parameters, see here. Make sure not to override the pid and c parameters, because these already exist on the attribution link behind the banner.",

      " Important! Beginning sometime in the first half of 2023, all app owners will be required to confirm ownership of any Android or iOS mobile app both for new and existing apps. If the app ownership has not been confirmed, advertisers will be unable to optimize their app ads for mobile app installs. Beginning April 7, 2022, app owners of new apps added to Meta ads (formerly Facebook ads) will be required to confirm their ownership of the apps. This change applies to all Meta advertising platforms such as FB, IG, Messenger, FAN, etc, and to all operating systems.

      " Can I still advertise an app if I haven\u2019t authenticated it?The only way to continue advertising unauthenticated apps submitted after April 7, is to add the associated app store link and not optimize for app install. App authentication only restricts the usage of app install optimization, not advertising overall. Do I have to republish my SDK on Play Store or App Store after adding the app-ads.txt?Yes, an app owner would have to update their app store listing on the Play Store (Android) and the App Store (iOS) after adding app-ads.txt to their developer website, as the app store listing would need to be updated to the new developer website. This is only required if a developer website was not previously listed on the app store listing. Note: This is not a requirement on App Store or Play Store.

    "answers": [
      "At a glance: SendGrid, an email delivery and analytics platform, embeds AppsFlyer OneLink within emails. When email recipients click on the link, they are deep-linked into your app. Introduction ESPs (Email Service Providers) can be excellent sources for segmented user traffic. One of the problems with ESPs is recording clicks while still persevering deep linking functionality. ESPs wrap the deep linking URL with their own ESP's click recording domain. This procedure oftentimes breaks the iOS Universal Links process. However, with ESPs that support Universal Links on top of their click recording domain, deep linking and click recording can still be performed. Prerequisites iOSAndroid",
      "AppsFlyer iOS SDK version 4.9.0+",
      " AppsFlyer Android SDK version 4.9.0+ SendGrid doesn\u2019t support Android App Links. However, URI Scheme deep linking is still supported. No special actions are required to support deep linking in Android apps from SendGrid. Setting up SendGrid Step 1: Set up link branding in SendGrid In order to use Universal Links with SendGrid, you need to create a dedicated click recording domain and set a subdomain (for example, click.example.com). This can be done by purchasing a designated domain or using your own domain. Subdomain configuration is accessible in SendGrid via \u201cAdvance Settings\u201d, by checking the \u201cUse a custom link subdomain\u201d and adding your subdomain: For more information, refer to SendGrid documentation: https://SendGrid.com/docs/ui/account-and-settings/how-to-set-up-link-branding/ Step 2: Set up SSL for click recording After you set click recording domain and Link Branding, follow SendGrid's instructions on how to enable SSL click and open recording for an authenticated domain. Step 3: Apple app site association file (AASA) hosting Obtain an AASA. There are two ways to do this: Ask your developer to review Apple guide on universal links. The guide explains how to create the AASA. Alternatively, if you set up OneLink with Universal Links, you might already have an AASA associated with the OneLink. To obtain the AASA, go to OneLink configuration, find a OneLink that is configured with Universal Links, and obtain the OneLink ID. The OneLink ID appears on the first column of the table that lists all existing OneLink configurations. Once you have the ID, paste it to the following URL in the browser address bar, and click enter: <OneLinkSubdomain>.onelink.me/.well-known/apple-app-site-association. When you do so, the AASA file is downloaded to your computer. You can open it using any simple text editor. Host the AASA in your click recording domain server. The file should be hosted in the path: click.example.com/.well-known/apple-app-site-association.",
      "Important! Once the AASA file is hosted, any change of your OneLink configuration (either modification or replacement) requires generating a new AASA file. Step 4: Configuring your AppsFlyer SDK Note If you haven\u2019t already done so, make sure you have configured your app to support deep linking with OneLink. After configuring your click recording domain to support Universal Links as described previously, you need to set up your app to deep-link and resolve that Universal Link. Associate the click recording domain in Xcode: Provide the click recording domain to the SDK API setResolveDeepLinkURLs. This API needs to be called before SDK initialization. For more information please refer to SDK documentation here. [[AppsFlyerLib shared] resolveDeepLinkURLs = @[@\"example.com\",@\"click.example.com\"]; When the app is invoked due to a click on the Universal Link, the AppsFlyer SDK resolves the deep link and extracts the underlying OneLink. All deep link parameters are then propagated into the onAppOpenAttribution API for deep link logic execution. Step 5: Sending your first email Create a OneLink URL in the Link Management page (or manually) When creating the OneLink URL make sure to URL encode all parameter values The following parameters are highly recommended to use: pid (media source) - Use a media source that signifies this usage such as Email. c (campaign) - The name of the campaign you want to measure af_dp - The deep link URI scheme you want to deep link your users into af_web_dp - Where to redirect users clicking the link on a desktop computer af_ios_url - Where to redirect users that don\u2019t have the app clicking the link in an iOS device af_android_url - Where to redirect users that don\u2019t have the app click the link in an Android device Place the OneLink URL in the email you are creating in SendGrid's Code Editor or Design Editor. To enable Universal Links for it, include the attribute \"universal=true\" in the HTML link tag of your email template. Example: <a href=\"links.example.com\" universal=\"true\">Link to your app!</a> Note that SendGrid adds the `/uni/` parameter when \"universal=true\" is included. If the email is retargeting existing users, add to OneLink the parameter is_retargeting=true.This converts the attribution link from a user acquisition type URL to a retargeting URL. Learn more. At this stage, SendGrid wraps the above link with the click recording domain that you set in the previous steps. Any click on the click recording domain will redirect to the OneLink attribution link.",
      "Example URL parameters are not URL encoded in this example, just for the sake of readability: https://example.onelink.me/abcd?pid=Email&c=Spring_Newsletter&is_retargeting=true& af_dp=testapp://path/to/content&af_web_dp=https://www.example.com/path/to/content& af_ios_url=https://www.example.com/path/to/content&af_android_url=https://www.example.com/path/to/content Step 6: Testing your links After following all the required steps mentioned above, creating the appropriate OneLink URL, and placing it in an email, send yourself a test email. What should you expect? If you have the app installed, the app should be invoked. If the relevant AppsFlyer SDK deep linking APIs are implemented you should be deep-linked into the relevant content.In addition, a click should appear in both the AppsFlyer dashboard, attributed to the provided media source and campaign, and also in SendGrid's data"

      " BI developer considerations Scope of data in the report The reports contain user attributions, installs, re-attributions, and re-engagements, and their related in-app events. If you use the unified view in your data loading process, you must use logic to split the data between campaign types, which means, user attribution (installs) and retargeting (re-engagements). To do so, use the conversion_type and is_primary_attribution field. See Double attribution of retargeting events. Field-level considerations Use post-attribution days to enable easy calculation of retention metrics. Calculating unique users using campaign name and campaign ID dimensions: If you can disregard campaign name granularity, you can sum unique count on campaign ID and the metrics are correct. You can aggregate the data using the campaign hierarchy fields. Revenue in USD is calculated using the exchange rate on the event day. Ad revenue events are included where available but can update with a lag of up to 3 days. General considerations The data of all apps is provided in a single file. Use the App ID field to segregate data per app or set Data Locker to segregate by app. Calculating the number of unique users per cohort To calculate the number of unique users per cohort by conversion type, for example, the number of users installing the app you must filter the data so that conversion_type=install and event_name=af_conversion. Sum the event_count column. You can add dimensions by including additional columns. To calculate the number of installs per day, group by conversion_date. This is illustrated by the SQL statement and Excel visual that follows. SQL statement SELECT app_id, conversion_date, media_source, event_name, conversion_type, Sum(event_count) AS total FROM 'REPLACE_TABLE_NAME' WHERE app_id='REPLACE_APP_ID' AND conversion_type='install' AND event_name='af_conversion' GROUP BY 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 Excel example",

You can map to any of these in-app event data identifiers as key identifiers: AppsFlyer ID (af_id): A unique app identifier generated by AppsFlyer at installation \u2013 This ID appears in all events recorded by AppsFlyer. A new ID is generated if an app is deleted and then reinstalled. ",
      "Customer User ID (CUID): A unique user identifier usually generated and set by the app owner at the time of user registration. Using CUID to map data requires that your app is configured to send the CUID to AppsFlyer via the SDK or the server-to-server API (S2S).",

Android app ID = package name (such as com.coolcompany.coolapp) iOS app ID = id + 9/10-digit App Store ID (such as id123456789) The custom source column that you map to App ID must be categorized as either an identifier or dimension.",
      " Mapping schemes (direct/indirect) If the report includes more than one custom source, only one of them needs to be mapped directly to an in-app event key identifier. Other custom sources can be mapped either directly or indirectly, as illustrated in the following example: Example In the scenario shown above: Custom source #1 identifier AF is mapped directly to the in-app event key identifier af_id. Custom source #2 is mapped indirectly: user_code --> AF --> af_id. Custom source #3 is mapped indirectly (through a longer chain):user_id --> user_code --> AF --> af_id.

Note that it could have been mapped indirectly instead (through custom source #3 identifier user_id), but either option works fine.",

      " Determine treatment of multiple matching events (only for reports containing custom sources) In many cases, the in-app event data will include more than one event during the selected timeframe with the same key identifier. When this is the case, you must instruct the DCR which matching events it should include in the report. Matching all events The most comprehensive matching method allows your report to include all matching events. In order to achieve this result, you must map an identifier in one of the report's custom sources to the in-app event data identifier install_time. The identifier in your source that is mapped to install_time must be in the following format: yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss. Note: Though the name of the in-app event data identifier is install_time, it actually means event time. Matching a single event If you do not map an identifier to install_time, you must elect to use either the last or first matching event in your report. Last event: The in-app event included in the report is the last event (chronologically) in the timeframe that matches a specific key identifier. First event: The in-app event included in the report is the first event (chronologically) in the timeframe that matches a specific key identifier. Make this selection based on the event you consider to be most relevant to the insights you want to obtain from the report.",
      "The remaining tabs are relevant for all in-app event reports, whether or not they include custom sources. Select dimensions Recall that user-level data cannot be reported by the DCR. Instead, it provides you with the decision-making insights you need by aggregating (or grouping) the data by the dimensions you choose. A dimension is generally an attribute by which you categorize app users (for example, geo, install date, campaign, etc.) Extracting dimensions from event_value When in-app events are reported to AppsFlyer via the SDK or the S2S API, much of the raw data is contained in a single field called event_value. This structured data field includes all of the specific in-app event parameters that have been configured for the events that your apps send to AppsFlyer. One of the major advantages of In-app event reports is that they allow you to extract specific parameters and their values from the event_value field for the events you choose. To extract dimensions from the event_value field for use in DCR reports: In the Dimensions from sources list, click the button. The Extract field from event_value window opens. In the Report field box, enter the name of the extracted dimension as you would like it to appear in your report. From the Event_value parameter list, select the in-app event parameter that should be mapped by default to the report field (dimension) you defined in step 2. The available parameters include those that have been configured in the selected in-app events in the selected apps.",
      " It may be that the default mapping differs by app and/or event. If this is the case: Click the Add exception button Select the app and event for which the report field should be mapped differently. Select the in-app event parameter that should be mapped to the report field for this combination of app/event. Follow these steps for as many exceptions as you want to set up. When you are finished setting up the mapping for the extracted dimension, click Save and add another to extract another dimension from the event_value field or Save to return to the main screen. To edit extracted dimensions: In either the Dimensions from sources or the Report dimensions list, hover over the name of the dimension you want to edit. Click the button that displays to the right of the dimension. Select Edit extracted field. Make changes to the Report field name and/or parameter mapping as necessary. Click Save to save your changes. To delete extracted dimensions: In either the Dimensions from sources or the Report dimensions list, hover over the name of the dimension you want to delete. Click the button that displays to the right of the dimension. Select Delete field. Caution! If you delete an extracted field from the Report dimensions list, it will delete the definition of the extracted field. If you wish to remove the field from the report while preserving its definition, select the field and use the Remove button instead.",
      "Selecting report dimensions In-app event report dimensions can include: Dimensions you've extracted from event_value Default in-app event dimensions Any field in the custom sources used for this report that has been categorized as a dimension (if applicable) To select the dimensions to include in your report: Select one or more dimensions in the Dimensions from sources list on the left and use the Add button in the middle of the screen to add them to the list of Report dimensions. You can use the search bar to search for dimensions in the lists. To remove a dimension, select it from the Report dimensions list and use the Remove button to return it to the Dimensions from sourceslist. Repeat this process until you have added each dimension you want to include in the report. Note: By default, all reports are grouped by the in-app event dimension media_source. If you do not wish to use this dimension in your report, you can remove it from the Report dimensions list. [Optional] Customizing dimension display names By default, dimension names are displayed in your report exactly as they are named in the in-app event data or your custom sources. If you wish, you can customize dimension names for your report. To customize dimension display names: In the Report dimensions list, hover over the name of the dimension whose display name you want to edit. Click the edit button that displays to the right of the dimension. Change the name to the dimension display name to be used in your report (up to 50 characters). Click OK to save the display name, or X to cancel it. Note: If you want to change the name of an extracted dimension, use the steps for editing extracted dimensions (above). Preserving privacy while grouping by dimension (regrouping) Depending on the size of your data set, the number of dimensions you choose, and other factors, it's possible that a report would include one or more groups of only 1 user. Reporting the data in this way would violate restrictions against providing user-level data. However, instead of removing or hiding the data from the report completely, the DCR uses a regrouping mechanism to provide as much detail as possible while maintaining user privacy. Regrouping example Assume you have set up a report according to the following dimensions (in order): In-app event dimensions: media source campaign adset_name ad_id",
      "Custom source dimensions: user_type",
      "Before regrouping After initial analysis of the data, the DCR determines that the data would break down as follows:",
      "mediasource campaign adsetname adid usertype revD0 revD7 count reportable?",
      " facebook_ads UA_100 green kjh867 buyer 1 4 12 \u2713",

      "facebook_ads UA_200 green ilk945 beg 3 21 1 X",
      "facebook_ads UA_200 green plm654 beg 8 17 1 X",
      " As it stands, the final three rows are not reportable because each row contains only 1 user. According to the regrouping logic, the DCR first \"eliminates\" the last-listed in-app event dimension (which, in this case, is ad_id). It then analyzes the data again to see which rows are reportable. After regrouping After applying the regrouping logic, the report appears as follows:",
      "mediasource campaign adsetname adid usertype revD0 revD7 count reportable?",
      " facebook_ads UA_100 green kjh867 buyer 1 4 12 \u2713",
      "facebook_ads UA_101 green jkj987 ultra 2 23 22 \u2713",
      "facebook_ads UA_200 green RESTRICTED beg 17 45 3 \u2713",
      " Results: The last row now combines the data that had previously been on 3 rows. The combined row now has a user count of greater than 1 and can be reported. The dimension that was eliminated is now reported as RESTRICTED. Had there still been unreportable rows (number of users=1), the DCR would continue to analyze the data on an iterative basis, eliminating one dimension after another until it either: can report all rows; or runs out of in-app event dimensions to eliminate",
      "Note: By default, the DCR applies regrouping only to default in-app event dimensions (not to extracted in-app event dimensions or custom source dimensions). If data grouped by a default in-app event dimension would result in a row containing only 1 user, the data in that row will be reported as RESTRICTED.

      "At a glance: Overcome the attribution challenge of mobile app advertising on podcasts by using one of several AppsFlyer solutions. Podcast attribution methods Podcasts are a relatively untapped source of mobile user traffic. Podcast users may react favorably to mobile app ads, but attribution is a challenge. That is because podcasts don\u2019t have a visual interface that generates user impressions or clicks. However, there are options that bypass these limitations to successfully perform podcast attribution: Dedicated landing page Chartable Firing a OneLink click from a dedicated Podcast app Dedicated landing page A podcast call-to-action (CTA), when it advertises a mobile app, usually involves mentioning an app name so users can search for it. In a dedicated landing-page scenario, the CTA is a specific web destination on a landing page. This page includes a web element (button, banner, etc.), powered by OneLink. To easily create dynamic landing-page banners without coding, we recommend using Smart Banners. Users who engage with this element, and install the mobile app, are attributed according to the OneLink parameters.",
      "Example You decide to promote your app on Joe Rogan's podcast and use a dedicated landing page. Joe smokes, speaks about your app, and then finishes with \"go to www.greatapp.com/joe and get 25% off\". The landing page has a Download app banner with a OneLink URL. The URL includes the media source \"podcast\" (&pid=podcast) and the campaign name \"joe\" (&c=joe). Users, who click the OneLink URL and install the app, are attributed in the AppsFlyer platform, to the \"podcast\" media source and the \"joe\" campaign. Firing OneLink click from a Podcast app This method overcomes the lack of visual interface and allows user attribution without visiting a dedicated landing page. In a Firing OneLink Click scenario, the Podcast app fires a OneLink URL click (or impression) when a user is exposed to the ad. Normally this occurs at the end of an ad, but it can be timed differently. Users, who install an app after listening to a podcast ad, are attributed according to the OneLink parameters.",
      "Example You decide to promote your app on the \"Making history\" podcast, which supports firing OneLink directly after users listen to the ad. The OneLink URL contains device ID, media source \"podcast\" (&pid=podcast), and the campaign name \"making history\" (&c=making%20history). The ad mentions the name of your app several times, but without a specific URL. Yet, in AppsFlyer, users that install the app are attributed to the \"podcast\" media source and the \"making history\" campaign. Who gets the attribution? In AppsFlyer, the \"podcast\" media source is considered a custom media source, and not an integrated partner. However, by integrating with AppsFlyer, Podcast app owners can receive postbacks for installs attributed to them. Podcast app owners are welcome to contact AppsFlyer's partner development group. Chartable Chartable is a new podcast measurement partner that places its measurement in the Podcast RSS field of a URL. In a Chartable scenario: Chartable is set up in AppsFlyer for a specific app. When AppsFlyer detects a new install, it sends device details to Chartable. Chartable then checks and self-attributes the mobile user who is identified from the URL\u2019s RSS field. Currently, Chartable receives information from AppsFlyer, but doesn\u2019t send any information to AppsFlyer. Consequently, Chartable self-attributes installs which AppsFlyer attributes to other media sources. Learn more about the Chartable solution."

      "At a glance: Record post-install rich in-app events (such as login, register, or in-app purchase) attributed to media sources and campaigns.",
      "Related reading For a complete picture of working with in-app events, be sure to read these articles: In-app event postback configuration Rich in-app events\u2014Overview (this article) Rich in-app events\u2014Event structure Why record in-app events? In-app events provide insight into what is happening in your app and are the ideal tool to determine the value of app users and the quality of traffic originating from different media sources. Recording in-app events helps you measure KPIs such as ROI (Return on Investment) and LTV (Lifetime Value). When users perform registrations, complete tutorials, add items to the shopping cart or make purchases, the in-app event data can record the events with the details. The implementation of in-app events is mandatory for all post-install analysis purposes. About in-app events An in-app event comprises an event name and can include event parameters. When you add event parameters to an in-app event, it is referred to as a rich in-app event. Event parameters provide you with more context and information about the occurring event. For example, while it helps to know that a user made a booking, event parameters can provide you with details such as the type of purchase, destination, and revenue.",
      "Predefined and custom events In-app events that you want to send require your developer to implement code where applicable in your app. Event names and event parameters are classified as follows: Predefined: These are event names and event parameters that are commonly used among different apps. We highly recommend using predefined event names and event parameters as much as possible for the following reasons: Predefined naming allows automatic mapping of events to partners. If AppsFlyer decides to change the name of any event or event parameter, your implementation is backward compatible.",
      " Custom: These are event names and parameters that you define for specific user scenarios that occur in your app. You can use any custom event name or parameter name string, but keep in mind that custom events need maintenance by your developer. See Tips and Limitations.",
      " Revenue events Whenever you send in-app events such as a purchase or flight booking, you send it with its associated revenue. The sole parameter that carries revenue in in-app events isaf_revenue Recording revenue in the SDK Recording Revenue in Unity You can also record negative revenue in case a user cancels a purchase or if you issue a refund. To record negative revenue, all you have to do is append the minus sign (-) to the revenue value that you pass toaf_revenue af_revenue is the only parameter that accumulates your users' revenue. Always use it with in-app events that represent actual revenue generation in your business logic. The range of this value should be $-10,000 to $+10,000 or the equivalent original currency amount. Values outside of this range are included in raw data reports but not in aggregate reports. af_revenue can also bear negative revenue values if you need to record events such as canceled transactions or refunds. Note: Do not format the revenue value in any way. It should not contain comma separators, currency, special characters, or text. A revenue value should be similar to 1234.56, for example. AppsFlyer provides revenue value with precision of up to five decimal places. AppsFlyer displays the exact revenue as sent from the SDK. It does not include any calculations for VAT or app store commissions, etc., unless these were included by the developer on the SDK side prior to it being sent to AppsFlyer. af_currency represents the currency that is stated in af_revenue (or af_price). If af_currency is missing from the event's parameters, AppsFlyer sends it with the default value \"USD\". You can use af_price as a monetary parameter that is not counted as revenue (such as in an \u201cAdd to Cart\u201d event). This parameter refers to the individual item price. The total amount of all purchases appears under the af_revenue parameter. Revenue currency It's important to understand how AppsFlyer handles currency settings and currency conversion. AppsFlyer handles the difference between app settings currency and in-app events currency using currency conversion. The diagram above demonstrates the following process: In-app events are sent - different currency for each event AppsFlyer normalizes all currencies to USD AppsFlyer processes revenue data Revenue data in the dashboard is displayed in app settings currency AppsFlyer populates revenue data in raw data reports in both event and app settings currency AppsFlyer uses Open Exchange Rates for currency conversion. The exchange rate is updated on an hourly basis. Whenever AppsFlyer performs currency conversion, it uses the exchange rate of the last hourly update. Currency conversion Example In your app settings, you set currency to GBP. A user from France purchases a product using your app. The price is quoted in EUR (\u20ac). The in-app event that you send to AppsFlyer looks like this: Map<String, Object> eventValue = new HashMap<String, Object>(); eventValue.put(AFInAppEventParameterName.REVENUE,200); eventValue.put(AFInAppEventParameterName.CONTENT_TYPE,\"category_a\"); eventValue.put(AFInAppEventParameterName.CONTENT_ID,\"1234567\"); eventValue.put(AFInAppEventParameterName.CURRENCY,\"EUR\"); AppsFlyerLib.getInstance().trackEvent(getApplicationContext() , AFInAppEventType.PURCHASE , eventValue); In this case, AppsFlyer converts revenue from EUR to USD and then to GBP. Let's assume the exchange rate is \u20ac1 = $1.13. So \u20ac200 becomes $226.85. Next, AppsFlyer converts from USD to GBP. Let's assume the exchange rate is $1 = \u00a30.78. So $226.85 becomes \u00a3176.92. Currency display Currency is set in the app settings. The currency that you set in the app settings, is the currency that appears in the dashboard. No matter what currency you send in-app events, the revenue in the dashboard always appears in the currency that you set in the app settings. Example Let's say that you send in-app events with different currencies than the one set in the app settings, or with no currency at all. In this example, currency in the app settings is set to GBP. You send three in-app events to AppsFlyer. Event A has revenue of 234 and GBP as currency Event B has revenue of 171 and EUR as currency Event C has revenue of 171 but no currency specified Revenue data in the dashboard The revenue that appears in the dashboard is the converted value from the in-app event currency to USD and then to the app settings currency. If no currency is specified in the event, AppsFlyer defaults to USD. The dashboard displays the event and revenue as follows:",

      "Sending events There are several ways to send in-app events to AppsFlyer: AppsFlyer SDK: This is the most common way to send events. You can send rich in-app events that record user actions in the app using the AppsFlyer in-app events API at the SDK level. Sever-to-server API: Use the server-to-server API to send events that occur outside the mobile app, directly to AppsFlyer. For example, if you have a user who is active on both web and mobile interfaces, you can record events from both sources and attribute them to the same user in AppsFlyer. It can be either an in-app event or other events, such as website events, call-center events, or purchases in your brick-and-mortar store. Receipt validation: This is a secure mechanism where the payment platform, for example, Apple and Google, validate that the in-app purchase took place as reported. Validating purchases is the primary tool to prevent fraudulent revenue events. It also helps you see what the real revenue is, and filters out incomplete in-app purchases. Hybrid apps: These apps combine native views and HTML content and can also record in-app events. However, because the SDK can only send events from the native side, developers have to forward all event data to native code.

In some jurisdictions or use scenarios,the IP address can be regarded as PII. We use the IP address to derive the broad geographic location (city, district level) of the device but not the specific address. If needed, you can select tomask IP addressesso that they don't appear in raw data reports. In-app events are the only source of revenue data in AppsFlyer. You can attach a specific revenue value to each event, and view it on your app's dashboard. Learn more about the monetizing parameters.",
      " Limitations Keep in mind the following when defining event names and parameters in the app: We recommend using only lower-case alpha-numeric characters (a-z and 0-9) for your in-app event names. Event names are case sensitive, meaning that af_purchase and af_PURCHASE are two different events in the raw data. However, in aggregate reports (for example, Overview, or Events) they can be displayed as a single event. There is a cardinality limit of 300 unique events per day. Learn more Unique users are only counted for the first 100 events after they install the app. Event names cannot begin with these characters:\" = +- Event names cannot contain empty spaces. You can use underlined spaces (low dashes) before or after the name of the event. Event values should not exceed 1000 characters. If you include the referring URL as an event value, it must be URL encoded. Facebook has some limitations regarding event names and parameters. Read about the limitations here.",
      " FAQ The following section includes various FAQ about in-app events. How do I use the revenue parameter? You can send revenue values with any parameter name and event. However, to register the revenue (including negative revenue) in the AppsFlyer raw and aggregated data, you MUST use the af_revenue parameter. Always use it with in-app events that represent actual revenue generation in your business logic. af_currencyrepresents the currency that is stated in af_revenue (or af_price). If af_currency is missing from the event's parameters, AppsFlyer sends it with the default value \"USD\". For more information about the af_revenue parameter, see the Revenue Attribution guide.",
      "How does AppsFlyer attribute events? In-app events are attributed to the original media source of the app install. Upon the install of an app (first app launch) AppsFlyer uses various attribution methods to determine the attribution of the install. At the same time, the AppsFlyer SDK creates a new unique AppsFlyer ID, which is associated with the attribution details. Every consequent in-app event performed by the same device in the app has this ID. This enables AppsFlyer to attribute the event to the original media source. Advertisers can use this to follow the full user journey in their app. Events of recently retargeted users may have double attribution. AppsFlyer attributes events of attributed installs as organic when: More than 24 months pass after the install date The media source's terms dictate deleting the user-level data The user deletes the app's stored data on the device, forcing the creation of a new AppsFlyer ID.",
      " Are events recorded if a device is offline? If a user initiates an event when the internet connection is unavailable, AppsFlyer is still able to record it. This is how it works: SDK sends the events to the AppsFlyer servers and waits for a successful response. If the SDK doesn\u2019t receive a successful response, the event is stored in the cache. Once the next successful response is received, the stored event is sent to the server again. If there are multiple events in the cache, they are sent to the server, one after the other.",
      "Note The SDK cache can store up to 40 events, which means that only the first 40 events that happen offline are saved. Everything that follows, until the next successful response, gets discarded. The event time that displays in the raw data is the time the event is sent to AppsFlyer after the device goes online again. It is not the actual time that the event takes place.",
      " What are complex in-app events and how do I set them up? Complex in-app events enable sending multiple events in a single API call. They are useful when you want to see several closely related user actions grouped together (for example, adding several products to the basket in a single session).Example: { \"af_revenue\":\"50.87\", \"af_currency\":\"USD\", \"af_receipt_id\":\"57601333\", \"product\":[ { \t \"af_content_id\":\"1164_8186\", \t \"af_price\":\"8.97\", \t \"af_quantity\":\"1\" }, { \t \"af_content_id\":\"1164_8186\", \t \"af_price\":\"8.97\", \t \"af_quantity\":\"1\" }, { \t \"af_content_id\":\"1164_8186\", \t \"af_price\":\"8.97\", \t \"af_quantity\":\"1\" }, { \t \"af_content_id\":\"1177_8185\", \t \"af_price\":\"8.97\", \t \"af_quantity\":\"1\" }, { \t \"af_content_id\":\"0153_9077\", \t \"af_price\":\"14.99\", \t \"af_quantity\":\"1\" } ] }",
      "Caution Complex in-app events cause postback issues with Facebook and Criteo. If you need the event to be fully mapped with Facebook and Criteo, send separate events per user action (for example, send an Add to cart event per each added item). Use the in-app events raw data to group these events together.",
      " Can I add multiple items to a single transaction? You can add multiple items to a single transaction. Instead of single values per event parameter, you can have an array of items describing the transaction, separated by commas. The format should be a JSON string. Example In the same transaction, Mr. Smith purchases two identical shirts, one pair of shoes, and a hat from a US-based online store. The sequence in which each item is listed must be identical for each parameter. \"{\\\"af_content_id\\\": [\\\"123\\\",\\\"988\\\",\\\"399\\\"], \\\"af_quantity\\\": [\\\"2\\\",\\\"1\\\",\\\"1\\\"], \\\"af_price\\\": [\\\"25\\\",\\\"50\\\",\\\"10\\\"], \\\"af_revenue\\\": \\\"110\\\", \\\"af_currency\\\": \\\"USD\\\"}\" Multiple items are sent onward as an array in postbacks. Currently, Facebook and Twitter can't parse array parameters correctly. To assist with this issue, AppsFlyer sums up the number of items (af_quantity) instead of sending it to these SRNs as an array. In our example, Facebook would get af_quantity=4. Note Multiple items can be used with the following in-app events:af_add_to_cart, af_add_to_wishlist, af_tutorial_completion, af_initiated_checkout, af_purchase, af_rate, af_spent_credits, af_content_view, af_travel_booking, af_update",
      " How does AppsFlyer handle event deduplication? We have an in-app event deduplication mechanism. It checks all in-app events to see if there was an identical in-app event that came from the same appsflyer_id less than 10 seconds beforehand. If such an event is found, the mechanism removes the duplicate. Two events are considered identical if the following fields in both events are the same: Event name Event value App ID AppsFlyer ID",
      "Note Deduplication works only for in-app events which are sent from the SDK. S2S in-app events don\u2019t get deduplicated.",
      " How long does AppsFlyer retain user-level data and what are the deletion obligations? AppsFlyer retains user-level (raw-data) for 24 months except where otherwise directed, required, or allowed by law. Some SRNs/partners require attribution providers, including AppsFlyer, to delete SRN/partner-related user-level data before the expiry of the 24 month period. After deletion, events related to deleted users display as organic. Past aggregate data is not changed. For more information, see Data retention and deletion obligations.",
      "Do I need to add the OS (operating system) parameter to my events? The Android SDK and iOS SDK automatically add the OS (operating system) parameter. For the S2S API, starting July 1, 2021, you must send the OS (operating system) parameter for iOS apps. If you do not send this parameter, data is regarded as having come from an iOS 14.5 user, and this impacts the way raw data is made available."

    "title": "About exceeded dimensions and cardinality limits",
    "answers": [
      "At a glance: Why do some aggregate data dimensions display as exceededand how to prevent reaching cardinality limits. What are exceeded dimensions? AppsFlyer collects your install and event data and aggregates it. Data is aggregated using unique values populating a given dimension. The number of unique values in a dimension is called cardinality. Most analytics and aggregated reporting tools have cardinality limits per dimension. As a result, when the number of unique values in a dimension exceeds the cardinality limit, the remaining data is grouped in an exceeded group. The examples that follow illustrate cardinality and how it affects your reports. Example Example A: What is cardinality? The Campaign ID cardinality limit is 3000. If the number of campaign IDs reported on a given day exceeds 3000, then any remaining campaign IDs are grouped together in the Exceeded_CampaignID_Limit. Example B: Why are some events grouped in the Exceeded_Events_Limit group? Assume that Events' cardinality limit is 3. On a given day, 7 unique events are reported: A, B, C, D, E, F, and G. In other words, Events cardinality is 7. In aggregated reports, events A, B, C are listed separately. Events D, E, F, and G are grouped in the Exceeded_Events_Limit. Raw data isn't affected by cardinality limits. If a large part of your data is grouped in exceeded groupings, that data isn't broken down. This can lead to imprecise results in analytics reports. If needed, use raw data to build groupings without cardinality limits. The table that follows lists the cardinality limits.

Therefore, if you do see the site ID Exceeded_SiteID_Limit, it means there are too many used site IDs per the media source in question, and trying to optimize the source's traffic according to site IDs becomes less accurate and less effective. Tip \"Divide and Conquer\". Instead of using thousands of site IDs per media source, which distort your aggregate data, use a second parameter on your attribution links called af_sub_siteid. Define a small number of general site IDs (ideally up to 50), and assign all previous site IDs as sub-site IDs under these general site IDs. This enables you to:1. Prevent seeing Exceeded_SiteID_Limit2. Efficiently optimize according to significant site IDs traffic3. Perform deep analysis based on the site IDs and sub-site IDs in the raw data Note In the Retention Report, you do not see an Exceeded_SiteID_Limit but not all the Site IDs are shown. Site IDs are shown randomly but it is a UI limitation to show all (when they have exceeded the limit). To work around this issue, retrieve retention data from the master API.",
      " How to avoid getting exceeded sources? The long term solution Most advertisers won't encounter Exceeded sources as they don't normally define 3000 campaigns manually. If you do encounter Exceeded sources it's probably because one or more media sources is using dynamic values for names of campaigns, site IDs, ad sets, or ads. Dynamic in-app events within the app code may cause the Exceeded_Events_Limit source data to appear. Tip Use only static values for names of in-app events, campaigns, site IDs, ad sets, and ads to avoid getting Exceeded sources. Also please check specific tips per any Exceeded source above. The short term solution The long-term solution may take you a few days to a few weeks to fully implement. But what if you want to look at your data right now? As explained, an Exceeded source occurs when AppsFlyer receives the N+1 click (or event) source during a single day. It is possible that the more prominent media sources you use arrive later in the day, and therefore are combined with an Exceeded source's data. Here's a simple trick to minimize the effect of any Exceeded source you see: Tip Forget today and look only at data from yesterday and beforehand. Every day an aggregation process recalculates the last day's data and in retrospect assigns only the smallest (not most late) sources, to any Exceeded source. This ensures that the distortion caused by the overflow of clicks is minimal!"

    "answers": [
      "At a glance: AppsFlyer determines the media source motivating a user to install or re-engage with an app and attributes the user action to that source using the AppsFlyer attribution model. What is attribution? Attribution is the act of determining what motivated (caused) a user to install an app or to perform post-install acts like re-engagement and re-attribution. The attribution result is either: A non-organic media source: The user interacted (usually by way of impression or click) with a media source. Organic: The user did not interact with a media source. Note! For ease of understanding, we often refer to a user as being attributed organically. We know that this is not strictly true, as users installing organically aren't attributed at all. Attribution is essential to optimizing user acquisition, re-engagement efforts, and results. What is an app install? TheAttribution Model is a set of rules, that determine how credit for an event is assigned to touchpoints in conversion paths. Each of the players in the app marketing ecosystem, Google Play, App Store, Apple, CTV platforms, ad networks such as Facebook and Twitter, and mobile measurement companies, have their own attribution models. Each counts installs and events differently. What's important is not the difference between the models but rather that the rules are clear and are implemented in a manner that is unbiased. Enabling advertisers to optimize campaigns and compare the quality of user performance. It is important to understand the models and rules of the players you work with. Most important is to understand the model and nuances of the methods supported by AppsFlyer. In AppsFlyer, an attributable event occurs when any of the following occur: In the context of user acquisition: An install is recorded and attributed after the user downloads and launches the app. This means that in AppsFlyer, the timestamp of an app install is the first launch.

This allows AppsFlyer to match the click device ID with the device ID fetched by the AppsFlyer SDK. Device ID matching is the primary attribution method on iOS. Available IDs are: iOS devices: IDFA, IDFV Android devices: having Google Play services:GAID Android devices without Google Play services: OAID, Android ID, IMEI, Fire ID Device IDs can be hashed using SHA1 or MD5 on attribution links.",
      "Device ID matching using IDFV (iOS) The identifier for vendors (IDFV) is available in iOS 6.-0+. It is not subject to Apple ATTrackingManager and LAT mechanisms. It is always available and can be used for cross-promotional advertising of apps from the same vendor. AppsFlyer SDK collects IDFV by default. According to Apple, The value of this property is the same for apps that come from the same vendor running on the same device. An IDFV is generated by Apple when the user installs the first app of a given vendor. Meaning, Apple checks that there are no other apps from the same vendor on the device. As a result, deleting all the apps of a given vendor and then installing an app from the same vendor results in a new IDFV. You should send IDFV if available. It improves attribution. We make use of IDFV in a number of scenarios including: Cross-promotion attribution. Reinstall attribution on the same device. Raw data reporting. Audiences.",
      " Device ID matching for self-reporting networks Upon the first app launch, AppsFlyer checks in the app settings if traffic is expected from any of the self-reporting networks (SRNs), like Facebook, Snapchat, and Google Ads. AppsFlyer queries the relevant SRNs using the unique device ID of the new install. The query uses Mobile Measurement Partners (MMP) APIs as defined by the SRNs. Based on the response, AppsFlyer may attribute the new uses to an SRN.",
      "Probabilistic modeling Probabilistic modeling is a statistical technique leveraging machine learning to estimate campaign performance. Probabilistic modeling parameters are collected: Initially on the click or ad view (if enabled) Again when the app is launched Note for iOS apps: Starting iOS 14.5+ probabilistic modeling is limited to the context of owned media, cross-promotion, and consented web-to-app flows. In other contexts, Aggregated Advanced Privacy is used. Implementation characteristics Uses statistics and is not based on unique IDs. Is a fallback method, used in the absence of a referer or advertising IDs. Deterministic attribution methods, i.e., clicks with referrer or ID matching, are given priority if they occur within the lookback window. The attribution window is determined by AppsFlyer dynamically, based on the user network. The window duration is adaptive but shorter than the window of other methods (up to 24 hours). Click-through probabilistic modeling is always enabled. View-through probabilistic modeling needs to be enabled in the app settings page and in the integration tab of non-SRNs.",

AAP utilizes the Apple SKAdNetwork privacy levels as a minimum benchmark for its privacy-preserving thresholds. AAP is the default attribution model for Apple devices operating on ios 14.5+, except in cases that are explicitly permitted by Apple, such as owned media, and ATT consented users.

Upon the ad click, a click lookback window opens having a default duration of 7 days. Installs occurring within the lookback window period are non-organic and are attributed to the media source. Installs that occur after the duration of the lookback window are considered as organic installs. Often referred to as being organically attributed.

However some ESP, and this is a common ESP issue, don't perform correct attribution and deep linking. ESPs wrap a deep-linking URL with their own ESP click-recording domain. This procedure often breaks the iOS Universal Links process. However, there are ESPs that support Universal Links on their click-recording domain, so deep linking and click-recording can be performed. Integrating Salesforce Marketing Cloud with AppsFlyer Steps 1-4 described below are needed to support iOS deep linking. Prerequisites iOSAndroid AppsFlyer iOS SDK version 4.9.0 For iOS Universal Links you should perform the following in your SFMC environment: Purchase and implement Sender Authentication Package (SAP) Purchase an SSL Certificate (also known as SSL Configuration) and submit an SSL Request Form* To obtain Sender Authentication Package and SSL Certificate reach out to your Salesforce Account Representative or submit a deliverability support case via Salesforce Help.",

For more information please refer to SDK documentation here. AppsFlyerLib.getInstance().setResolveDeepLinkURLs(\"click.example.com\"); Important! If you are using Movable Ink (MI) in conjunction with Salesforce, you need to get the MI CNAME and internal domains from your MI account manager and add them to setResolveDeepLinkURLs, in addition to the click link for Salesforce.

      " OneLink frequently asked questions OneLink template FAQ Which method should I use for opening apps\u2014Universal Links, App Links, or URI schemes? Universal Links: Required for over 98% of iOS users App Links: For Android users with version 6.0+. Note: Samsung OS can't open apps using Android App Links. Note Both Universal Links and App Links require proof that the domain in the clicked URL (in other words, the OneLink custom link domain or branded domain) is owned and associated with the specific app it\u2019s trying to open. This domain association is done via the Apple App Site Association file (AASA) for iOS and Assetlinks file for Android. These files are either hosted by AppsFlyer or by the advertiser on its website. By default, when you create OneLink templates and set up Universal Links and App Links, these files are generated and hosted by AppsFlyer. URI schemes: The primary method for opening apps on Samsung devices. Otherwise, it is a legacy and fallback method for opening apps. Can be used: For Android users with versions prior to 6.0 (less than 15% of Android users) As a fallback for when Universal Links and App Links don't open the app, either because they don't work, or aren't set up. Note: Using URI schemes as a fallback for Universal Links is subject to iOS-based limitations. Learn more. Deep linking Universal Links, App Links, and URI schemes are secure methods for opening an app. To deep link and redirect users into specific activities or pages in the app, follow the OneLink deep linking instructions.",
      "Which operating systems allow URI schemes to open the app?",
      " OS Do URI schemes work to open the app?",
      " iOS Yes. Use as a fallback for Universal Links failure. Important notes: Using URI schemes as a fallback is subject to iOS-based limitations. For many browsers, including Safari, you must add the af_force_deeplink=true parameter to the URL to use URI schemes as a fallback. Learn more.",
      " Android Yes. Use for Samsung devices, Android versions prior to 6.0 and as a fallback for when App Links fail on later Android versions. Amazon No Windows Mobile No",
      " Do I need to update the app after iOS Universal Links and Android App Links setup? Yes. Whenever Universal Links or App Links are implemented to open the app for existing users, iOS Associated Domains or AndroidManifest.xml is updated. This means that you must upload a new version of the app to the relevant app store. Tip: To minimize the need for app updates, make all the dev-related changes required to open the app and deep linkat one time.",
      "Can I redirect existing users to a web page instead of the app? Yes. However, configuring your template to do so affects all users (new and existing), and sends everyone to the landing page/web URL. Meaning, new users are not sent to the app store. To send users to a web page: In your template, do not set up Universal Links, App Links, or URI scheme. Set up the redirections for when the app isn't installed to the landing page/web URL. The landing page/web URLs are added as the values for the af_android_url and af_ios_url parameters. The redirections are then automatically applied for when the app is installed (for existing users), as well.",
      "Note: If you want to redirect existing users to a mobile web page only after app launch, your app developer must configure that behavior.",
      "Can I redirect tablet users to a different app or URL then mobile app users? You can set specific redirections for: Windows phones iPads Amazon Kindle Fire. Other tablets are not currently supported for separate redirection.",
      "Can I assign an app to multiple OneLink templates? Yes. While you can use a single OneLink template to create a limitless number of OneLink URLs, in some cases, it might be necessary to assign an app to more than one OneLink template. For example, if you have multiple versions of an Android app for out-of-store markets, you may need a separate OneLink template for each Android version with the same iOS app assigned to all of them. Important: For templates using iOS Universal Links and Android App Links to open the app, if your templates have different subdomains, you need to configure and update your iOS and Android apps for each one: iOS Universal Links: After creating the new OneLink template, and updating the associated domain in the app, submit a new version to the App Store. Only iOS users who have updated to the new version can activate a OneLink URL built on the new template. Android App Links: After creating the new OneLink template, copy the XML snippet at the bottom of the App Link section and add it to the AndroidManifest.xml file inside the intent you want to deep link into, in addition to any previous intents. Release the new version to the store. Only Android users who have updated to the new version can activate a OneLink URL built on the new template.",
      " Can I delete a OneLink template? Yes, but only by contacting your CSM or by sending an email to our Customer Engagement team athello@appsflyer.com. Note: If you have existing OneLink URLs based on the deleted template, they won\u2019t work even to get users to the app store. For this reason, it\u2019s particularly important that you don\u2019t delete a template without first making sure that there are no OneLink URLs using it. Alternatively, consider if it's possible to achieve the results you need by changing the existing template's configuration instead of deleting it.",
      "Can I change the subdomain in a OneLink template? Yes, as long as there are no existing custom links in AppsFlyer based on the template. If there are already custom links in AppsFlyer based on the OneLink template, then the subdomain can't be changed. This limitation is designed to prevent breaking the redirection/deep linking behavior of live links. If you do need to change the subdomain in a template with existing custom links, you can either: Create a new OneLink template with the new subdomain, and create links based on it. Delete all existing custom links based on the template for which the subdomain needs to be changed. Once all links based on the template have been deleted, the subdomain becomes editable.",
      " Can the domain/subdomain of a OneLink template be applied to the template ID of another template? No. Taking the subdomain/domain configured to a specific template and template ID and manually concatenating it to a different template ID breaks the functionality of Universal Links and App Links, and poses a security threat. Example: Template 1ABC is configured with subdomain bank.onelink.me. Template D123 is configured with subdomain game.onelink.me. The link bank.onelink.me/1ABC/shorturl is created based on template 1ABC and works. The link game.onelink.me/D123/exampleurl is created based on template D123 and works. The link game.onelink.me/1ABC/shorturl doesn't work The link bank.onelink.me/D123/exampleurl doesn't work",
      " Can I use the same subdomain for more than one template? Yes. However, make sure you create separate templates with the subdomain; don't just manually add the subdomain to a template ID.",
      "How can I redirect desktop users? Desktop users can engage with your OneLink custom links, for example, via an email campaign. However, when desktop users click on these links, they cannot be redirected to a mobile site, app store, or app. So how can I give desktop users a good user experience and convert them into mobile users? In the OneLink URL or template, you can redirect desktop users (Windows or Mac) to a different URL. This web URL is added to the link in the af_web_dp parameter. Note: If your link contains af_web_dp, AppsFlyer does not register a click when it comes from a desktop. Tip Try redirecting desktop users to a web URL that contains a dedicated web form that sends a OneLink URL to the mobile device of the desktop user via SMS or email. Learn more about this option as part of the OneLink Smart Script solution.",
      " How can I redirect Chrome OS users? Apps on Chromebooks are considered to be Android apps. For Chromebook, to redirect new users without your app installed to a different web URL: In the OneLink template settings, under Set link behavior > When app isn't installed > Android, click Change to a different URL.ORIn the OneLink link settings, under Deep linking & redirection > Redirect > When app isn't installed > Android, select Web URL. Enter the URL.When added via the link settings, the URL is added to your link in the af_android_url parameter.",
      " OneLink link FAQ Does OneLink work without the AppsFlyer SDK? Yes, but only in part. If you need to convert mobile web visitors into mobile users fast and can't integrate the AppsFlyer SDK, it is possible to do so. Basic user redirection and app launching work even if AppsFlyer SDK isn't yet integrated into the app. Smart Banners don't require the SDK either and also work fine without it. However, the absence of the SDK means that: Clicking users can't be deep linked beyond the initial app launch. Attribution data isn't recorded. In-app events aren't recorded.",
      " What methods are available for creating OneLink custom links? The following table compares the different methods available for creating OneLink custom links.",

      " Can OneLink custom links open the app from a browser? Yes, but be aware that Universal Links and App Links only work when clicked on (for example, when clicking a link on a web page or email). Pasting the link in the browser address bar doesn't launch the app. Test your links by clicking on URLs; not by pasting them in the browser URL box.",
      "Why doesn't the OneLink URL open the app or deep link existing users? Despite the best intentions, in some cases, your OneLink URLs may not perform the intended deep linking. When this happens, instead of opening the app or getting deep linked into a specific activity within the app, users are redirected to the app store or to an error page. There are several possible reasons for this: Host applications: Apps in which your attribution links are shared (for example, WhatsApp, Gmail, WeChat) use different methods to activate clicked links, such as proprietary internal browsers. Some of these are known to block all attribution links. Browsers: Certain browsers and OS platforms behave differently with links. In certain browsers, for example, pasting a link does not work. The link must actually be clicked. OS updates: New OS updates (both iOS and Android) may introduce unexpected bugs that hamper deep linking. Devices: Different smartphones, tablets, laptops, and other devices running different versions of iOS, Android, Windows Mobile, and other operating systems can vary greatly in their handling of attribution links. Misconfiguration: The use of special characters in the deep linking value breaks the link. Two solutions for improving the user experience are Fallback URLs and forced deep linking. Fallback URLs Fallback URLs send users to specified web pages if opening the app or deep linking fails for any reason. Caution! They also send users without your app installed to the fallback URL instead of to the correct app store. So, be sure to only use this option if you're retargeting users with your app already installed. To implement a fallback URL, in the OneLink template or custom link settings, set the link behavior for when the app isn't installed to redirect to a different URL. Using this setting adds af_ios_url and af_android_url as destination parameters for the fallback, which will cause iOS users to be redirected to the page specified by af_ios_url and Android users to be redirected to the page specified by af_android_url. Example Consider, for example, the following OneLink URL: https://go.onelink.ly/qwerty?pid=source&af_dp=greatapp%3A%2F%2F&af_ios_url=www.yoursite.com/ios-bonus &af_android_url=www.yoursite.com/android-bonus Both iOS and Android users who click on this link should be deep linked into the app. However, when deep linking fails, users are redirected as follows: iOS:www.yoursite.com/ios-bonus Android:www.yoursite.com/android-bonus",
      " Note If you include a hash symbol (#) as part of a parameter value in the URL, you need to encode it. When redirection occurs, OneLink URL parameters pass through to the destination page specified by af_ios_url oraf_android_url. To prevent this behavior, add the parameter af_param_forwarding=false to the OneLink. Forced deep linking Forced deep linking allows you to use a URI scheme as a fallback to open the app and deep link users. This solution works well for most users who have the app installed. However, for iOS, using a URI scheme to open the app has limitations, and you may need to add af_force_deeplink=true to the OneLink URL to force deep linking into the activity specified in the URI scheme (the af_dp parameter). Learn more about URI scheme fallback for iOS.",
      "Why does my OneLink URL open a blank page in Chrome? Make sure you are not using an HTML <a> tag that includes the target attribute. If the OneLink URL is placed inside an <a> tag with the target=\"_blank\" attribute, it opens a blank page in Chrome (on both iOS and Android), and the user is not redirected to the App Store or to Google Play.",
      "Can I use OneLink for redirection on Brave? Yes. However, on Android, when a user clicks a OneLink link on a Brave browser, deferred deep linking doesn't work. And on iOS, after the user clicks, they see a blank screen, and deferred deep linking only works if they then do something on the blank screen, for example, scroll, or tap.",
      "Do OneLink custom links take longer to load than other links? No. OneLink custom links do not add any extra processing or load time to function properly and redirect users as required. They're just as fast as any other AppsFlyer links. ",
      "How can I record the cost per install when using OneLink? Turning on Enable cost per install (under Advanced parameters) allows you to apply a specific CPI value to each install coming from the link. Select the cost currency and then anumeric ONLY value (with up to 4 digits after the decimal point) representing the CPI. This adds the parameters af_cost_currency and af_cost_value to the link. Example An SMS campaign costs $20 per 1000 messages (CPM). Experience has shown that your campaigns achieve a 5% conversion rate, meaning the derived CPI is $0.40. Setting the cost per install to 0.40 USD allows you to measure the eventual ROI of the SMS campaign. Learn more about measuring cost and ROI. How can I prevent parameter forwarding on redirections? af_r,af_ios_url,af_android_url, andaf_web_dp carry over parameters from the attribution link or OneLink to the redirected page. To prevent this behavior, add af_param_forwarding=falseto the attribution link.",
      "Are single-platform custom links still available? OneLink is now the only supported method for creating custom attribution links for owned media. In the past, app owners could also use single-platform (app-specific) custom links without using OneLink. This method is deprecated, and new custom links can only be created based on a OneLink template. However, if you have legacy single-platform custom links, they still work as always. You can also view and edit your legacy links by clicking View legacy single platform links in the top right corner of the OneLink custom links page.",
      "Can I change the short URL ID after saving a link? No, the short URL ID can only be set at the time the link is created.",
      "Can I wrap and shorten OneLink custom links? External link shorteners or wrapping your OneLink custom links will break the app-opening functionality of Universal Links and App Links. In order to activate Universal Links or App Links, the OS needs to recognize the domain of the URL associated with the app, and any type of external wrapping, shortening, or redirecting to the user-facing link makes this impossible. This includes using bit.ly, non-AppsFlyer branded links, or Email Service Providers (ESPs) with click recording enabled. To wrap or shorten a link in a way that allows the redirection to work properly: Use the short URLs generated by AppsFlyer when you create OneLink custom links (instead of external shorteners like bit.ly).Tip! Make the URL even shorter by creating a short branded domain on your link. And if you're creating the links in the AppsFlyer UI, you can edit the URL ID to be as short as possible. Example: https://brand.com/a1b2/a (where brand.com is your branded domain, a1b2 is the template ID which is always 4 characters, and a is the URL ID, which can be edited down to 1 character.Benefits: This method works because it uses the OneLink subdomain configured in the OneLink template. It enables you to change parameters on the fly, including any deep linking settings, even after distributing the attribution links to your leads. It counts all the clicks from mobile devices in the AppsFlyer dashboard, so you don't need to check another service. The last part of the short URL can be customized to make it a branded domain. Use theURI scheme as a fallback to open the app when Universal Links and App Links fail, and add the following parameter to the link: af_force_deeplink=true. See options for working with ESPs.",
      " Can I use OneLink custom links in emails? Yes, but it requires special consideration when you're working with Email Service Providers (ESPs). In order to count performed clicks, ESPs wrap all links placed inside emails. This breaks the app opening/deep linking flow for users who click the URL. To prevent this, use one of the following optional solutions: Disable click recording in your ESP configuration.(Tip: This is generally the easiest solution.) Force the app open with the URI scheme specified in the af_dp parameter by adding the flag af_esp=true to the attribution link. This solution works well for users who havethe app installed. Use ESPs that support the AppsFlyer solution for app opening and deep linking with Universal Links. Learn more.",
      " How do users get redirected to their regional app store? OneLink redirects users to the correct regional app store based on their IP address.",
      "Why isn't my OneLink URL redirecting users to the specified domain? Check whether you have activated Redirect allowlists in AppsFlyer. If you have it activated, the desired web URL domain or subdomain must be listed. Learn more about Redirect allowlists",
      "OneLink parameter FAQ What parameters are mandatory for OneLink custom links? Only the media source (pid) parameter is mandatory.",
      "Can parameters be appended to the short URL? Yes, any parameter can be appended to the short URL. Important! Parameters appended to the short URL do not override the parameters inside the link. Example You create a OneLink custom link with the following output: Long URL:https://onelink-sim.onelink.me/Il2C?pid=training&c=peaches Short URL: https://onelink-sim.onelink.me/Il2C/70e6d165",
      " You append the following parameters to the short URL: https://onelink-sim.onelink.me/Il2C/70e6d165?c=bananas&af_adset=fruits The af_adset=fruits parameter appended to the short URL is effective for attribution. However, the c=bananas parameter is not effective since there is already a c parameter in the longURL.",
      " What custom media source names can I use? For owned media, custom media source names can be anything. However, it is recommended not to use organic as a custom media source name as this could affect attribution data integrity. If you're using OneLink for paid media: Use the integrated partner-reserved pid values (those ending with _int), as media source values in OneLink custom links. Don't use SRN media sources likefacebook,facebook ads,googleadwords, ortwitter, as custom media source names. This could affect attribution data integrity. Make sure the partner is integrated in AppsFlyer (with Activate partner toggle turned on) for all apps that are set up in the OneLink template. Best practice: Do not useorganic as a custom media source name. This could affect attribution data integrity.",
      "What attribution parameters can be added to a OneLink? You can add numerous attribution parameters to enable you to perform a thorough drill-down analysis.",

      "Integrated partner FAQ Can I use OneLink in social apps (unpaid)? You may want to use OneLink in unpaid posts on social apps since potential users who are exposed to such posts cannot be targeted in advance according to their devices. Unfortunately, iOS Universal Link limitations and restrictions set by some social apps complicate the use of OneLink for basic device recognition, redirection and attribution, and deep linking. In certain cases, it may be necessary to set up a Social app landing page or URI scheme in order to redirect or deep link users. The following table summarizes when OneLinks can be used in today\u2019s popular social apps:",
      " Social app Android users without app installed Android deep linking iOS users without app installed iOS deep linking",

      " Can I use OneLink with ad networks (paid)? Yes, but note that OneLink is mainly used with owned media, not with ad networks.This is because ad networks usually advertise in apps (which means they know the user's platform, device ID, and so on), app and platform-specific attribution links suffice, so using OneLink isn't necessary.However, for cases in which ad networks don't know the user platform in advance (for example, when they run email or SMS campaigns themselves), OneLink can be the solution. Important! When you use OneLink with ad networks, you must use the OneLink long URL. To set up OneLink for partner ad networks: Follow the ad network attribution link instructions, and select Use OneLink when prompted. Once all the parameters for Android and iOS are added correctly, when the OneLink custom link is clicked and the user is redirected to the right platform, the required parameters are sent to the network within a postback after the user installs. Example https://greatapp.onelink.me/3287867539?pid=network_int&c=email& idfa{$IDFA}&gaid={$GAID}&clickid=$SITEID& af_sub1=[pixel_code]&af_sub2=[creative] The network uses either the IDFA or GAID parameters according to the client's device platform and disregards the other parameter.",
      " How can I solve the iOS app-launching issue from social media apps? Facebook and other social media apps sometimes block iOS Universal Links from opening apps. Social app landing pages are the recommended solution for these app-launching issues. If you do not want to use Social app landing pages, you can use URI schemes as a fallback method. Note, however: Using URI schemes as a fallback is subject to iOS-based limitations. For many browsers, including Safari, you must add the af_force_deeplink=true parameter to the URL to use URI schemes as a fallback. Learn more.",
      " Can I use OneLink on Instagram? Yes, but be aware of the following limitations: Due to the way Instagram renders the text of a page post, links are not clickable when entered into a post caption. App opening and deep linking into Android apps are supported without any special considerations. However, Instagram doesn't support app opening and deep linking into iOS apps. To overcome this issue, you can take one of two approaches: Recommended: Configure a Social app landing page. The Clustered Poster and ShowAndTell templates work best. In addition to the Social landing page, we recommend setting a URI scheme in your OneLink template. Use a URI scheme and forced deep linking when using OneLinks on Instagram. Be sure to keep the following considerations in mind the following when using af_force_deeplink=true with OneLink on Instagram:",
      "App installed? Click hasaf_force_deeplink=true? Result",
      " No Yes Click opens the app store No No Click opens the app store Yes Yes Click opens the app Yes No Click opens the app store",
      " Can I use OneLink for redirection on WeChat? WeChat overrides Android and iOS deep links and redirects users to a web page. From the web page, the user must click the Options button and choose to open the page in a browser. As a result, users encounter a broken user experience, increasing the chance for them to drop off in the conversion funnel. To overcome this, OneLink recognizes clicks in WeChat and loads a dedicated landing page instructing the user to click the options button and then to click Open in Browser. This, in turn, opens the redirect URL defined in the OneLink template setup. If the user\u2019s WeChat language is registered as Chinese, OneLink generates a localized version of the landing page:",
      " Why are Android users with the app installed being redirected to a web URL and not into the app when they click a link on Facebook webview? Opening the app and deep linking from an ad on Facebook is usually possible. However, if the following conditions apply, Facebook is not able to open the app for existing app users from the OneLink URL. Instead, all users, including those with the app, are sent to the URL defined in the OneLink template, or in the value of either the af_android_url, af_r, or af_custom_android_url parameter: User has an Android mobile device. Link is clicked on the Facebook app. Link leads to an HTML page that opens in Facebook webview (either a site or social app landing page). The HTML page contains a link with both an af_dp parameter (with a URI scheme) and a URL redirection setting in either the OneLink template or in a parameter (one of af_android_url, af_r, or af_custom_android_url).",
      " Testing FAQ How can I A/B test the Social app landing page? The social app landing page gives users a seamless app-launching experience when using OneLink in social network apps. You may be concerned that adding a step to the funnel decreases conversion rates. But the truth is, that without the landing page, user journeys are generally broken, resulting in very low conversion rates. If you're not fully convinced, why not test it? A/B test your custom link in social media apps, with and without the Social app landing page. To A/B test the Social app landing page: Create a OneLink link (called Link1) to use with social media apps. Don't set the Social app landing page for this link. Add the af_adset attribution parameter. Add the af_adattribution parameter with the value \"no lp\". Test Link1 outside of social media apps, and verify the link works and launches your app correctly. Duplicate Link1 and call it Link2. Change the af_adattribution parameter value to \"using lp\". Create the Social app landing page for Link2 only. Publish 2 different posts in the same social media app, using Link1 and Link2.Don't worry about the different number of clicks each link produces. The important KPI is the final conversion rate of each link. Check the A/B test results after enough traffic is created. Go to the AppsFlyer overview dashboard and scroll down to the Aggregated performance report table. Link1 and Link2 have the same media source, campaign, and adset name. Drill down to the specific adset. Compare the conversion rates (and other KPIs) of users that clicked either Link1 or Link2.",
      " How can I bypass the app selection dialog? If you see an app selection dialog when testing your OneLinks, make sure to sign your app, even if it's a debug app. The certificate you use to sign the app is the same certificate you use to generate the SHA256 fingerprintwhen configuring OneLink for App Links.",
      "Deep linking FAQ What deep linking methods should be implemented? Your developers should implement the unified deep linking (UDL) method for deep linking. See our full instructions for deep linking. iOS Universal Links and Android App Links are app-launching methods, which don't actually deep link users (sending them to specific content within the app). The URI scheme method can launch the app and deep link users (via the af_dp custom link parameter), but it should only be configured for app-launching. Its main usage is as a fallback method for Universal Links and App Links and for app-launching users with Android OS versions prior to 6.0. After the app is launched using any of these methods, the AppsFlyer SDK supplies the deep_link_value specified in the custom attribution link. This value should be delivered via the UDL method implemented by your developers.",
      "Can a URI scheme (af_dp parameter) be used for deep linking? Yes, but it's not recommended. Ideally, you should use the deep_link_value for deep linking, and the URI scheme as a fallback method to launch the app without deep linking (via the af_dp parameter). However, if you already have the URI scheme set up to deep link, with additional parameters concatenated as part of the URI path (for example, greatapp://param1/param2), there is no need to change your existing configuration or code; the URI scheme will continue to work.

      "At a glance: Attribute installs from cross-promotion campaigns that promote your apps on other apps you own.",
      " Related reading For a complete picture of working with cross-promotion attribution, be sure to read these articles: Cross-promotion attribution for marketers (this article) Cross-promotion attribution for developers About cross-promotion Cross-promotion campaigns are one of the best ways to promote your existing apps or guide your users to new apps launched by your company. Not only is cross-promotion attribution free to all account plans, but these types of campaigns can result in higher conversion and retention rates compared with most other sources of traffic. Since cross-promotion is advertising on owned media, you can use device ID matching to deterministically attribute new installs. The following image shows the promoted app's dashboard with a breakdown of metrics for campaigns running on owned media (af_cross_promotion) and other media sources. You can see that the number of installs and conversion rate for the cross-promotion campaign are much higher than those for the other media sources. How does cross-promotion work? The user is served a cross-promotion ad on an existing app your company owns. The ad is promoting another app also owned by your company. The ad creative can be a banner, video, or any clickable object. [optional] The SDK records and sends a cross-promotion impression to AppsFlyer. The user clicks on the ad. The SDK records the click and redirects the user to the promoted app's page on the app store. The click recorded by the SDK already includes the device advertising ID. Once the promoted app is installed and launched, the AppsFlyer dashboard shows the newly acquired user under the media source af_cross_promotion. To change the media source value, your developer needs to add a custom parameter called pid with the value you want. Note: For Android, this only works for SDK V6.4.2+. The app driving the install, the source app, appears as a Site ID of this media source.",
      "The SDK generates an in-app event automatically.The event name for Android is af_cross_promotion and for iOS it's af_cross_promotion_clicked. Attributing cross-promotion AppsFlyer allows you to use device ID matching as the attribution method for recording and attributing installs that originate from your cross-promotion campaigns. You can attribute both impressions and clicks, enabling you to calculate the click-through rate or installs/impressions ratio. The device identifier used for matching depends on the following: The user's device and OS version The version of the AppsFlyer SDK in the source app",
      " Device ID matching for cross-promotion Device/OS version SDK version Notes",
      " IDFA iOS 9 \u2013 14.4 V5.0.0+ IDFV iOS 14.5+ V6.0.2+ IDFV is collected automatically; no further action is required by the developer. GAID Android devices with Google Play services OAID, Android ID, IMEI, Fire ID Android devices without Google Play services ",
      "Setting up cross-promotion The process of setting up the cross-promotion attribution requires that the marketer and the developer work together to implement additional code in the AppsFlyer SDK. The flow for the marketer and the developer is as follows:",
      "Step Role Task Details",
      " 1 Marketer Decide on the existing apps in which to run the cross-promotion campaign. The source app attributed with the install will appear as the Site ID in the promoted app\u2019s dashboard.",
      " 2 Marketer Determine if you want to add additional parameters such as lookback window, ad set name, and subscriber parameters. Send these additional parameter names and values to the developer. ",
      "3 Developer Implement the code in the SDK. Developer documentation is here.",
      "4 Marketer In the promoted app's dashboard, view the traffic coming from the cross-promotion campaign and optimize your campaigns accordingly. ",
      "5 [Optional] Marketer Create a custom dashboard to compare cross-promotion traffic and share data with account users. ",
      " Viewing cross-promotion data Promoted app dashboard The promoted app's dashboard enables you to determine which source apps send the best traffic to the promoted app. To compare traffic from source apps: Go to Overview. Select the af_cross_promotion media source (or your custom media source). Group by Site ID to view the list of source apps. Analysis Viewing the installs, clicks, impressions, and conversion rate data from several existing apps all serving ads for the same promoted app enables you to perform affinity analysis. The source apps (Site IDs) with the best conversion rates have the best affinity with the promoted app, and their users are most likely to install it. Based on these insights, you can optimize your cross-promotion campaigns accordingly. Example You are a marketer of gaming apps for PlayIt Gaming International. You have a number of successful apps, including Bowling (com.playit.bowling) and Golfing (com.playit.golfing). You have just launched a new app called Billiards. You decide to run cross-promotion tests to see how many users actually click on the Billiards ad in one of the existing apps. The campaign runs well on Bowling, with a conversion rate of 7.92%, so you decide to advertise on Golfing as well. When you check the dashboard you see that the conversion rate for Golfing,18.22%, is much higher than the rate for Bowling, which allows you to determine that there is a greater affinity between Golfing and the promoted app, BIlliards. Based on these insights, you could optimize your campaign as follows: Run a full-scale cross-promotion campaign on Golfing. Start to attribute impressions in addition to clicks. Since you initially set up your campaign to measure only clicks, installs from users that see the ad without clicking and then install later are counted as organic installs instead of non-organic. This means you don't yet have a complete picture of the campaign performance for each source app. Custom dashboard The promoted app's dashboard is great for getting a picture of which source apps are driving the best traffic. But what about if you want to evaluate the performance of a single existing app being used to promote multiple apps? This is where a custom dashboard can do exactly what you need. A custom dashboard allows you to view information from several promoted apps in one place, including cross-promotion traffic. In addition, a custom dashboard is a quick and easy way to share data with account users. Example You are a marketer for eCommerce Apps, Ltd., and you have a highly successful app called Shoes. You are now launching 3 new apps, Accessories, Jackets and Coats, and Sport Shoes. You decide to run a cross-promotion campaign in the Shoe app to see which of your new apps it does the best job of promoting. You divide your user base into 3 segments. Each time a user launches the Shoe app, 1 out of 3 possible ads is displayed: 1 for Accessories, 1 for Jackets and Coats, and 1 for Sport Shoes. To view metrics for all 3 promoted apps in one place, you create a custom dashboard. In the following image, you can see that Sport Shoes has a 20.23% conversion rate, meaning that Shoes has a much greater affinity with Sport Shoes than with the other 2 apps it is promoting."

URL parameters\u2014group and priority The AppsFlyer website attribution solution supports several campaign parameter classes. The classes are ranked in priority as follows: [Highest priority] PID UTM [Lowest priority] Click IDs from specific channels like Google, DoubleClick, and Microsoft.

      " 9 utm_medium Media type UTM Y media_type",
      " 10 utm_campagin Campaign UTM Y campaign",
      " URL parameter best practices Selecting URL parameters Each parameter class functions in the context of a silo. As such, if you need URLs with multiple classes, the URL must have the relevant parameters of each class. By doing so, your reporting granularity is optimized. The use of parameters of multiple classes is illustrated in the context of Facebook ads as follows: PID group: www.website.com?pid=facebook_int&c={{campaign.name}}&af_c_id={{campaign.id}}&af_adset={{adset.name}}&af_adset_id={{adset.id}}&af_ad={{ad.name}}&af_ad_id={{ad.id}} UTM group: www.website.com?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=paidsocial&utm_campaign={{campaign.name}} If you combine classes but include only some of the required parameters, AppsFlyer might not provide the full granularity. For example, if you use www.website.com?utm_source=facebook&c={{campaign.name}} the following occurs: AppsFlyer uses the UTM class because there is no PID class and determines the media source using utm_source. However, the campaign can't be determined since c= is part of the PID class, but pid isn't included. To solve this, assuming you need the utm_source for other purposes, consider this option: www.website.com?pid=facebook_int&c={{campaign.name}}&utm_source=facebook. With this structure, AppsFlyer uses the PID class to identify the media source. Other PID parameters, such as c=, can be included and the utm_source is disregarded because it has a lower priority.",
      " Implement dynamic URLs using ad network macros Use network macros (AKA valuetrack params) to save time when building templates and applying URL parameters for paid campaigns. Networks use different macros to populate the parameters in the URL. Consequently, you must check ad network documentation to verify that you use the macros correctly. For example, if you want to pass the campaign name in the c= parameter, you can avoid hard coding the actual campaign ID for each URL, and just use the macros:",
      "Google Adwords: www.website.com?af_c_id={campaignid} Facebook ads: www.website.com?af_c_id={{campaign.id}} Pinterest ads: www.website.com?af_c_id={campaignid} Snapchat ads: www.website.com?af_c_id={{campaign.id}} Microsoft ads (Bing): www.website.com?af_c_id={campaignid}",
      "Consistent case within parameters Parameter values are case-sensitive. For example, utm_source=channel1 and utm_source=CHANNEL1 are regarded as different media sources. As such, verify that you are consistent with regard to the letter case. Use Google Ads integration to automate granularity In the case of Google Ads campaigns, you can get campaign granularity by integrating PBA with your Google Ads account. This ensures that your data is populated with all campaign hierarchy data without the need for PID or UTM parameters on the URL. Common URL parameter mistakes to avoid Question marks Use only one question mark between the URL landing page and the parameters There should be no other question marks used in the URL For example, www.website.com?parameters Example incorrect uses: www.website.com??parameters www.website.com?parameter1?parameter2 Anchor signs Anchor signs (#) should not be used in the URL. Use of an anchor sign in a URL can result in the parameters after the sign form not loading and not being collected by our web SDK."

      "At a glance: Add signature validation to clicks to avoid fraud liabilities and so fraudulent clicks aren't attributed to your ad network. About click signing With minimal tech, fraudsters can send clicks on behalf of an ad network and create thousands, or even millions, of fake clicks that get sent to AppsFlyer. Sometimes, the ad networks themselves aren't aware of the issue. In order for an ad network to ensure that clicks attributed to it by AppsFlyer actually originated from the ad network, and not from a fraudster creating fake clicks, ad networks should sign their clicks with HMAC-SHA256 signatures. The code adds the following Click signing also prevents the ad network\u2019s traffic from being blocked due to click flooding. Meaning, if an ad network reaches the click blocking threshold due to an extreme level of click flooding, AppsFlyer stops recording and attributing their clicks for the rest of the day. The signatures enable AppsFlyer to validate the clicks and make sure that the click information hasn't been manipulated by fraudsters. Validated clicks are recorded, and attributed to the ad network Invalidated clicks are rejected and: Are made available in Protect360 reports for ad networks (not advertisers).

This is to protect your business from a potential technical issue and allows you to find the cause of the anomaly: If you find that the signature is working as expected and the clicks are being correctly blocked, disable the circuit-breaker using the configure circuit breaker method. If you find that clicks are being incorrectly blocked: Make sure that you have a valid secret key by checking the click signing configuration using theget configuration method.

      "FAQ",
      " Q: How can we test click signing without impacting production? A: There are two ways to test click signing: Use the test API. This method is useful during the development phase, to test the signatures of single clicks. Use report-only mode. Report-only mode verifies the signatures on the production clicks and shows you what would be blocked, but doesn't block invalid clicks. Therefore, you can test that click signing works without impacting real traffic.",

      "Full campaign cost data Use Ad Spend Ingestion to aggregate campaign costs from media sources that don't report cost by click or API. Doing so enables you to have a complete picture of your campaign costs and ROI in the Dashboard. Cost must be recorded at the campaign level with other dimensions in the advertising hierarchy being optional. The spend (cost) is reported by using CSV files uploaded to the dashboard for ingestion. Updated aggregate cost data are available in the Dashboard within 4 hours of ingestion. Advertisers and ad networks can send and manage spend files. Agency support is on the roadmap. Previously ingested ad spend data can be overwritten if required. Example use cases: Record the costs incurred originating from networks that do not send cost data by API or attribution link Offline channels, like radio campaigns and billboards Influencers To manage Ad Spend Ingestion go toIntegration> Ad Spend Ingestion.Note: The Ad Spend Ingestion page is an account-level page.

App transfer between accounts In order to transfer an app between AppsFlyer accounts, both the sending and receiving app owners (as represented by their AppsFlyer account admins) must complete the necessary transfer prerequisites and agree to the transfer. App transfer process The following is an overview of the app transfer process: The sender requests that AppsFlyer transfer the selected apps and enters the receiver admin's email address. The receiver is notified and agrees to receive the apps. Both sender and receiver admins receive notice of the pending transfer (both by email and on the My apps page). While the transfer is pending, either admin can delete the app transfer request (cancel the transfer). After verifying that the sides have completed the transfer prerequisites, AppsFlyer transfers the apps. If a prerequisite is incomplete, AppsFlyer contacts the relevant party to ensure completion. Incomplete prerequisites usually relate to pending financial, commercial, or legal matters; or to the requested transfer of apps comprising more than 30% of an account's traffic over the last 90 days.",

It is important that you use the correct protocol. To find out if the setting is secure, check whether the analytics (SSL) setting is set to true in the ADBMobile.config file. If your connection is secure use HTTPS, if it is not secure use HTTP. REPORT SUITE ID can be found as the rsids variable in your Apps\u2019 Config file. You can give any name to your report suite.

      "At a glance: Import predefined audience segments from your internal systems (such as BI and CRM) to AppsFlyer Audiences, allowing you to use Audiences to connect and maintain these segments with your advertising partners. Why import audiences? In certain circumstances, you may have predefined audience segments in your internal systems. Importing these audiences (as lists of device and/or user identifiers) to AppsFlyer allows you to use Audiences as your central point for connecting and maintaining all of your audience segments with your advertising partners. Additionally, it enables you to take full advantage of other Audiences features, such as identifier matching/data enrichment and connected campaign metrics. Consider the following examples: Examples Promotional remarketingYou want to target promotional offers to users during the month of their birthdays. Here's how to do it with Audiences: Use your internal CRM to generate a list of users along with their birthdays. Segment the list according to birthday month, and export it as individual lists of advertising IDs. Import the lists to AppsFlyer as audiences and connect them to the partners with which you want to run the promotional campaigns. Set up campaigns with the relevant partners to target the audiences accordingly. Acquiring additional usersYour app development studio acquires another studio. The studio you acquired has the device IDs of users who previously installed their apps, and you want to target these users to install your existing apps. Here's how to do it with Audiences: Obtain the list of device IDs from the studio you acquired, and import it to AppsFlyer as an audience. Connect the audience to the partners with which you want to run campaigns. Set up campaigns with the relevant partners to target these users accordingly. Audiences import V2.0 The remainder of this article describes concepts and procedures related to the new Audiences import feature V2.0 (with options for importing by CSV and API). Legacy procedures for Audiences import V1.0 (CSV and API) can be found here. Imported audience types When you import an audience, you designate it as one of two types, which determines how AppsFlyer treats the uploaded audience, both in terms of processing and uploading it to partners. This election is made when an audience is first imported and can't be changed later. A standard imported audience: Undergoes identifier matching and data enrichment\u2014a process in which Audiences matches imported identifiers with existing identifiers in the Audiences database (for the same user on the same app) in order to enrich audience data uploaded to partners. Is uploaded to partners subject to your account's user identifier policy. Must be imported using the V2.0 import feature described in this article. An \"As-is\" imported audience: Doesn't undergo identifier matching and data enrichment. Is uploaded to partners without reference to your account's user identifier policy (meaning all imported identifiers are uploaded to partners). Can only include device IDs such as GAID, IDFA, or OAID when uploaded as a CSV file. Can only include a list of identifiers without headers when uploaded as a CSV file. Can be imported using either the V2.0 import feature (described in this article) or using the V1.0 legacy import feature.",
      "Important! All audiences existing as of November 23, 2021, are designated as-is audiences and cannot be changed to standard audiences. You can continue to update these audiences as necessary using either the V2.0 import feature (described in this article) or the V1.0 legacy import feature. Only an admin can designate a new imported audience as an as-is audience. Audience import procedures Import an audience either by uploading a CSV file or using the Import Audience API. Import a CSV file Prepare a CSV file, with the following specifications: Format One column for each user identifier being uploaded A header row with the name of the identifier in each column (all lowercase) No blank rows Maximum number of rows: 10 million If you prepare the file using Excel, save it as a CSV (Comma delimited) (*.csv) file, as shown in the following image:",
      "identifier hash Columns and identifiers Data is ingested using the header row to identify the data in each column, therefore: There is no requirement that columns appear in a specific order. There is no requirement to include columns for identifiers not being uploaded. You can import as many identifiers as you want in a single CSV file so long as each row includes the required identifiers, as further detailed below. Available identifiers: app_id idfv idfa gaid oaid imei cuid emails phone phone_e164 braze_id amplitude_id Required identifiers: For Android audiences: app_id + one of: gaid OR oiad OR imei OR cuid OR braze_id OR amplitude_id For iOS audiences: app_id + one of: idfv OR cuid OR braze_id OR amplitude_id Note: app_id is not required for as-is audiences.

      " AppsFlyer GDPR Requests API Use the GDPR Requests API as described in this section to implement DSR compliance. GDPR Request:Perform one of the above request types: access, portability, erasure, rectification. Status Request: Query the current status of a GDPR request. Discovery Request:Inquire as to the supported API version and Data Format. Cancellation:Cancel a GDPR request during its pending phase. App Owners must implement UI changes to their app so that App Users can submit requests. Note that GDPR requests are per single user at one time. 1. GDPR request GDPR request flow The GDPR request types, access, portability, erasure, and rectification, have the same flow: App User submits a request. The App Ownerconstructs the GDPR request (see below) and sends it to AppsFlyer. AppsFlyerreceives the request and responds with a \"201 OK\" for valid requests. During the following 48 hours, the request is queued and has apending status. The App User may cancel the request. After 48 hours, the request status changes to in_progress. AppsFlyer sends a status change postback. At this point, the request can't be canceled. Within 14 days (see note below), AppsFlyer fulfills the request, and the request status updates to completed. AppsFlyer sends a status change postback. In the case of erasure or rectification, the App User's data is deleted. In the case of portability or access, the App User's data can be accessed in the AppsFlyer dashboard under GDPR or via the Request API (see below). Note: This 14-day period begins once the 48-hour pending period has ended. Thus, the total period for fulfilling the request is 16 days after the App Owner submits the request to AppsFlyer. GDPR request format A GDPR Request API can be submitted via HTTP POST to the following endpoint - https://hq1.appsflyer.com/gdpr/opengdpr_requests?api_token=[api token] For the API token use the same API token as for Pull API.

    "title": "SKAN CV Decode (map your CV to events)",
    "answers": [
      "At a glance: AppsFlyer decodes and transforms the conversion value set by you into events. The events are used to populate the SKAN dashboard, raw data, and postbacks to partners. Decode mode isn't supported for SKAN 4. Related reading: SKAN Conversion Studio (SKAdNetwork settings) Decode SKAN conversion value Advertisers use conversion value decode as an alternative to using options available in Conversion Studio. If you use Decode, it means you are responsible for setting updateConversionValue according to your app logic. Apart from setting the conversion value (CV) in the app, the remainder of the flow, features, and reporting options are the same as those described in the SKAN solution guide. This means that at the expiry of the activity window (controlled by you), iOS sends the postback to the ad network, which forwards it to AppsFlyer. AppsFlyer decodes the CV according to your mapping into events processed just like decoded CVs set by the SDK. Note! Decode mode isn't supported for SKAN 4. Custom conversion value\u2014Decode Implementing custom CV decode requires uploading a CSV file containing your CV mapping to the AppsFlyer platform. Decode mapping principles Provide decode mapping for conversion values 1-63. It's not mandatory to map the entire range of values. For example, you can map values 1, 2, 10, and 43. CV 0 is always mapped to install. You can't set it. The mapping table is uploaded to AppsFlyer in a CSV file. You can upload an updated mapping table as needed. Upon receiving a postback from iOS, the CV is decoded into events, as illustrated in the examples. The install time is derived using the postback arrival time. Events have the same time as the install time. To best understand how to prepare the schema, review the mapping scenarios that follow. Custom in-app events names are allowed. Meaning you send new event names, even if they haven't ever been sent by the SDK. You can map the in-app events to ad network in-app events. This is also true for Facebook integration, subject to the Facebook-specific rules detailed in the next section.",
      " Decode mapping scenario rules Consider: Conversion value range: 1-63 A given conversion value maps to one or more in-app events specified by you. In-app events have optional parameters. For the examples: assume that the install date is Feb 1 at 08:00. The table that follows is an example decode mapping table. Its structure is similar to that of the CSV file required. Following the table are the events generated as a result of the decoding process. An install event is always generated, irrespective of your mapping. Revenue measurement: Revenue is in USD. A given conversion value has a revenue range bounded by min_revenue and max_revenue. In aggregated reports and dashboards, revenue is calculated as the average of the range. Example: min_revenue=4 and max_revenue=10. The calculated revenue is 7. Raw data reports include the calculated revenue (skad_revenue), min_revenue, and max_revenue.",
      "Facebook-specific rules If you integrate with Facebook, adhere to the following rules: Min and max revenue values for a given conversion value must be different. Meaning not equal.

For agencies, the process is almost identical to that of the marketers. Upon going to the setup window of any regular ad networks the attribution link is already there. The only difference is the automatic addition of the af_prt parameter to the attribution link. Ad network configuration visibility Ad network setup is visible to ad networks themselves only when the marketer (app owner) configures it. When an agency activates and configures ad network integration, the network sees this section as inactive. af_prt parameter The value of af_prt is the agency name. The Agency name that is passed in the af_prt parameter is always converted to lowercase. Having af_prt with your agency name on an attribution link that results in new installs enables attributing new installs to your agency account. Without af_prt a new install can't be attributed to any agency account, and therefore it gets attributed directly to the ad network. Do not use links received from the marketer: make sure to use the links from your own account to prevent wrong attribution. Special case: All-installs and all-launches networks Some non-SRNs require (or allow) marketers to send them postbacks for devices that aren't attributed to them. All-installs network The network accepts a postback for every new app install, from any source All-launches network The network accepts a postback for every new app launch, from any source Some examples for all-installs networks are Vungle, Wechat, Startapp, Unity Ads, and more. The following table shows the full list of the all-launches networks:",

      "How to setup agency attribution with all installs/launches networks? Working with these networks entails sending information from installs that are not brought by the agency. Therefore, these networks require the marketerto configure them BEFORE the agency. Example Let's use agency attribution setup with Tapjoy as an example: Marketer goes to Tapjoy setup window on the marketer's dashboard. Marketer enters the Tapjoy App ID, given to the marketerby Tapjoy, in the app_id text field. Under the Integration tab > Default postbacks, the marketer selects All media sources, including organic. Agency goes to Tapjoy setup window on the agency's dashboard. Agency enters the Tapjoy App ID, given to the agency by Tapjoy, in the app_id text field. Owned media\u2014OneLink and custom links Your agency can attribute all installs that originate from media sources that are not ad networks, such as:",
      "Email addresses Phone users database Web site banners Social media content (NOT social media ads)",
      "To attribute installs from owned media you must create a custom attribution link, which automatically contains af_prt with your agency's name for correctly attributing to your agency. Custom links for multiple platforms (Android and iOS) can be created using OneLink, which allows using one link only for all kinds of end users, no matter the device type. OneLink can also be used for deep linking (see the next section). Setting up OneLink requires creating a OneLink template first. The template includes a subdomain, which can also be a Branded Link. OneLink templates and Branded Links cannot be created by agencies; only by app owners. If you'd like to start using OneLink, either:",
      "Use an existing template: When creating a new custom link, the available subdomains and Branded Links display in a dropdown. Contact the app owner so they can create a template for you. The app owner can create a special Branded Link for you.",
      "Make sure you are a partner for all the apps selected in the OneLink template. Note: For agencies to use a OneLink template, they must be partners for all the apps in the template. Deep linking Deep linking is the launch of a mobile app when opening personalized content and/or sending the users to specific activities within the app. This can provide your users with superior user experience and enhance their engagement. For deep linking to work, the mobile app MUST be developed with deep linking capabilities and infrastructure. Contact the app owner to find out whether the app is suitable for deep linking, before setting up the campaigns. Retargeting",
      " Retargeting attribution allows you to target existing or past users in your campaigns. Retargeting campaigns often require deep linking capabilities to work correctly.",
      "In-app events App owners can have various events in their apps (e.g. purchase, watching a tutorial, passing a level, etc), that they can record and analyze in AppsFlyer. Agencies can see data of events attributed to them on the Events page in their account. In-app event postbacks Agencies can be given permission to configure in-app event postbacks (including the af_app_opened event) to ad networks, upon receipt of permission from the Marketer. Agencies can give the ad networks permission to configure in-app postbacks to themselves.Permission is granted by marketers in the agency permission tab.",
      "Reporting for agencies Traffic statistics are viewed and downloaded directly from the AppsFlyer dashboard. Reports are accessed via the Export Data page in the AppsFlyer dashboard. You can also access Cohort reports via Data Locker. The following reports types are available: Aggregate Raw data Marketers and agencies mostly cannot access the same data in the dashboard, reports, and so on. Agencies are usually responsible for only a part of the marketer's traffic, so the agencies' access to the data is limited in comparison to that of marketers. This article breaks down these differences. The following sections highlight them Note Due to Facebook and Twitter's terms of service, agencies, who are considered 3rd parties, do not have access to raw data reports traffic, originating from either Facebook or Twitter. Access to performance reports Performance reports also referred to as aggregate reports, are available by default to agency accounts.Related reading: Aggregate performance reports Access to aggregate organic data reports requires marketerpermission. Access to raw data Raw data reports (user-level data reports) contain attribution information and are divided into topics. Agencies can receive access to Retention and Cohort reports, and Protect360 dashboard. This requires that the marketer enable Allow access to your retention and cohort reports or Allow access to your Protect360 dashboard, respectively, in the integrated partners' permissions tab. Time zone and currency Agencies see apps in the app-defined time zone and currency, but these settings can be changed only by marketers. Cost reporting Agencies can enable Get cost data when configuring an integrated partner that supports cost data. To enable Get cost data: In AppsFlyer, select the app for which you manage campaigns. In the app dashboard, click on Integrated partners. Search for an integrated partner that supports cost data. Click on the integrated partner's name to access the configuration page. Switch to the Cost tab. EnableGet cost data. Enter the API key for this partner. Click Save. Accessing and viewing cost data Cost data is available to the agency in the following data sources: Overview page: cost data is visible in the Aggregated performance report in the Overview page. Reports: cost data is available in exported reports such as Installations under Raw data reports and Partners (Media sources) under Performance reports Hybrid account data access Hybrid accounts are agency accounts that manage some of the apps as an Agency (app partner), and some as a Marketer (app owner). The following account-level features have limited availability: Custom dashboard: not available for agencies and hybrid accounts. Cohort report: available upon marketer's permission. Protect360: available upon marketer's permission. If you have a hybrid account, they may appear on your dashboard, but you will get a 404 error when trying to open them. If you would like to use these features, it's recommended to open a new Marketer account and separate your Marketer and Agency apps. The features mentioned above will be available in your Marketer account if you have them enabled."

      "At a glance: Google Marketing Platform (GMP) is an AppsFlyer self-reporting network (SRN) partner combining advertising and analytics. Google Marketing Platform App Attribution Integration (DV360) Google Marketing Platform (GMP) brings together advertising and analytics to help you make quality customer connections, surface deeper insights, and drive better marketing results. This article relates to the new GMP App Attribution Integration API, which leverages a link ID for conversion measurement. This integration is designed to replace the Legacy Integration for Third-Party App Tracking. Note If you want to use the API, you must contact your GMP account manager. The AppsFlyer internal name for this integration is dv360_int. In the context of AppsFlyer, the following GMP solutions are relevant: Campaign Manager 360 (CM360): Ad management and measurement system for advertisers and agencies enabling mobile marketers to plan, execute, and measure their display campaigns across websites and mobile. Display & Video 360 (DV360): Demand-side-platform (DSP) providing trading desks, agencies, and advertisers with transparency and performance in global display media buying across ad exchanges. Integration principles Integration with GMP is based on GMP Floodlight Activities, which are tags associated with given conversion events. You can map in-app events like subscriptions and purchases to Floodlights. This enables conversion measurement and reporting between AppsFlyer and GMP.

      " Priority measurement component Use the priority measurement component, part of Custom mode, to rank user action journeys in the app based on your business logic so that high priority measurements override low priority ones. This enables you to choose what to measure in each step of the conversion funnel. Each priority (maximum 63) can contain revenue, in-app event, or both. When a user performs events in the app, AppsFlyer determines which priority fits the actions performed by the users and sets the CV accordingly. For ease of understanding, let's compare using Custom with and without the priority component. Without priority, AppsFlyer maps all possible measurement combinations to CVs. Whereas with priority only measurement combinations explicitly set by you are mapped to CVs. Priority is best explained in the detailed example in this article. Priority principles You can set 1-63 priorities. The number available depends on your activity window and Single Source of Truth settings. Priority 1 always has the highest priority. The priority with the biggest number has the lowest priority. A priority consists of revenue or in-app event, or both components. A given priority can contain multiple in-app events and revenue streams. Funnel isn't available in priority. However, set multiple in-app events in a priority to measure user conversion in a funnel. To use the priority measurement component, you can't have other components, such as in-app events or revenue configured. To set measurment using priority: In AppsFlyer, go to SKAN Conversion Studio. Select Custom, click Continue. If necessary, click Delete, to remove the current settings. Click + Add measurement.Select Priority.Priority 1 displays. Select a measurement component from: Revenue In-app event Complete the fields according to the user interface. Consider that a priority can consist of revenue, in-app event, or both. Range values of event occurrences and revenue must be of ascending (increasing) order and be continuous. For example, the following ranges increase and are continuous: 1-5, 5-8, 8-10, and so on. A given range can be used more than once (repeated) if the second time it's used is part of a unique combination and is the same range as the last priority with a range.

      "At a glance: Advertisers use Validation Rules to manually define conditions to block installs, attribution, and in-app events of non-compliant installs/IAEs. Integrated partners (ad networks and agencies) can view the rules and get reports of blocked installs, attribution, and IAEs. About Validation Rules Validation rules: Are defined by the advertiser in a rule builder using customized conditions and logic that filter and select which app installs or in-app events to keep or block. Are based on a variety of parameters for multiple use cases, including: Untargeted installs for the advertiser's campaign (wrong geo, OS version, etc.). Installs that do not meet the insertion order signed between the advertiser and you. Hijacked installs by fraudulent publishers, malware, etc. Fake installs or in-app events sent from bots, emulators, or device farms. Defined for in-app events only take effect on IAEs associated with installs that were not previously blocked. That include an ad network are visible to that ad network's personnel (but they cannot see other ad networks included in the rule). Run in real time and take immediate action. A rejection postback is sent to partners who have rejected postbacks set up. Learn more. Have additional options available to Protect360customers, on top of the automatic Protect360 fraud blocking and detection.These conditions are known to help in the detection of various install-hijacking, fake install, and fake in-app event fraud types. Availability to ad networks and agencies The rules governing validation rule access to ad networks and agencies are as follows: Integrated partners can see the list of validation rules that apply to them. They see that other partners are included in the rule, although the other partner names are undisclosed. If a validation rule applies to multiple apps but a partner is only integrated for one or some of the apps, it can only see the rule and the app for which it's integrated. To click a specific rule and view its details requires permission from the advertiser to View validation rules. By default, the permission is turned off. If off, a partner can click Request access. The advertiser then receives a notification of the request. An ad network can't create or edit rules. Agencies The rules governing additional validation rule access to agencies are as follows: Agencies can create, edit, and delete rules, if they have permission from the advertiser to Add validation rules. Agencies can only edit or delete rules they create, not those created by the advertiser. To add add rules with Protect360 conditions: The advertiser needs to have a Protect360 subscription. Permission is needed from the advertiser to Access Protect360 dashboard & raw data.",
      "If an agency makes a rule for multiple apps it is integrated with, and then integration for one or more apps is removed by the advertiser, the rule is split into separate rules for each app, and the rules for the apps that aren't integrated are inactive.

      " Why doesn't the source or condition display as a suggested value when I search for it? There are two possible reasons: Make sure the relevant app/s are selected. If the app isn't selected, values don't display in search results. Results display only if the value you are searching for appeared in your traffic during the past 30 days. Additionally, there is a lag of up to 1 day between when the conversion occurs, and when the source or condition displays as a menu option. If the value does not appear as a search result, you can type the value as free text and press the Enter key on your keyboard.",
      "Why do my media source options only include Facebook Ads and Twitter? The Media Sources field options are affected by your Agency selection. If \"non-transparent agency\" is selected as one of the traffic sources, no media sources display except for Facebook Ads and Twitter, which even non-transparent agencies need to be transparent about. Note: If your rule applies to multiple apps, any agency that is transparent in some of the selected apps, but non-transparent in others -is considered as non-transparent. This means you can't select specific media sources other than Facebook Ads or Twitter.",
      "Is it necessary to have \"and/or\" both within specific conditions and between condition groups? It depends on your use case. Sometimes either option achieves the same results. Other times, both options are necessary. For example, if in USA you support installs only on OS V10 or later, but in Brazil, you support from V7 and later, you'll need a rule like: {[Geo = US] and [OS version = 10]} OR {[Geo = Brazil] and [OS version = 7]}",
      "Do validation rules block clicks? No. Validation rules can block installs, block attribution to an install\u2019s sources (that prevents the media source of a click/impression from receiving attribution), or block in-app events. However, none of these options blocks the actual click, and click KPIs are not affected by executing validation rules.",
      "Looking at the raw data, I see that installs I expected to be blocked by validation rules have a different block reason than my rule name. Why is that? This means the block was due to the Protect360 engine and not a validation rule. See also multiple rules.",
      "Do existing rules automatically apply for newly-integrated agency traffic? This depends on your Source settings, as described in the table below. If the rule is not automatically applied, you must edit the rule: Change the Agency field to either Agency and non-agency traffic, or select the specific agency.",

      " Note: SRNs have user-level data use and retention restrictions. Attribution with SRNs Each SRN has a unique attribution policy and reporting method. Note that this leads to differences in how and what SRNs report to AppsFlyer. How does attribution work with SRNs? Unlike non-SRNs (ad networks) which use attribution links to report events to AppsFlyer, SRNs communicate with AppsFlyer events, such as new installs and in-app events, differently: SRNs use APIs to communicate with attribution and measurement providers. When third-party attribution providers detect an install, they query the network using the advertising ID. SRN reports the details of any relevant ad clicks or impressions. AppsFlyer uses its standard attribution logic to sequence the relevant impression and click data. AppsFlyer attribution is based on both last-touch and multi-touch methodologies.",
      " Install attribution Potential app users see and interact with multiple ads before they install an app. In general, attribution providers offer advertisers last-touch attribution\u2014this attributes an install to the last click made before the actual install. When an app is first launched: AppsFlyer checks that: The app is set to receive traffic from SRNs. The user has an advertising ID. If both conditions are true, AppsFlyer queries SRNs using the advertising ID. AppsFlyer performs attribution after considering SRN claims. Install attribution examples Example A Monday: Network A reports a user click. Tuesday: Network B reports a video engagement. Wednesday: Network C reports a click on a playable ad and, 30 minutes later, there is an install. AppsFlyer attributes the install to Network C and gives Networks A and B credit for assistingwith the install. AppsFlyer gives advertisers assist data (unattributed engagements that occur before an install). This lets advertisers customize their multi-touch or fractional attribution models. See thisshort explanation. Note that in the case of Apple Search Ads (ASA), AppsFlyer gets the attribution information from within the SDK. If available, AppsFlyer sends back to ASA only the time and date of the app launch.",
      "Example B Network D (SRN) reports a click a few minutes before Network C. Network C uses standard attribution integration. AppsFlyer attributes the install to Network C as they had the last click.",
      " Attribution windows Attribution windows include lookback and view-through.Some SRNs charge advertisers for an install based on Cost per Impression (CPM) and Cost per Action (CPA)\u2014these are based on clicks or impressions that occur within a 1-28 day period. AppsFlyer attributesinstall, activity, Effective Cost per Install (eCPI), and Effective Cost per Action (eCPA) based on an advertiser\u2019s preferred attribution methodology and lookback windows. Advertisers may have to pay for installs based on SRN attribution lookback windows and view-through models. Advertisers expect the AppsFlyer third-party universal attribution methodology to optimize and allocate their ad spend. Why? Because AppsFlyer reports actual eCPI and eCPA based on advertiser-defined terms. SRNs may benefit in the short term as they often define their own payment terms. But, advertisers correct this by using third-party attribution providers.",
      " Deep linking with SRNs For users to open your app when the link is clicked, you just need to set up App Links/Universal Links/URI scheme. However, to perform deep or deferred deep linking to a specific page or activity in your app, SRNs use their own methods\u2014without involving AppsFlyer's deep linking method. So how can you deep link your users and get the relevant data from SRNs? Direct deep linking Direct deep linking with SRNs when a user device performs deep linking is done without calling the AppsFlyer deep linking method. In the example below, existing users clicking an ad are redirected to the activity directly using Facebook's methods, while new users get the same experience using AppsFlyer's conversion data. Learn how Facebook uses OneLink for deep linking. Example Jill, the mobile marketer of \"greatapp\", decides to run a deep linking campaign on Facebook, targeted at general audiences. The campaign redirects any clicking users to a \"bonus\" activity.Jack, the mobile developer, adds this logic after getting the conversion data: Is it Facebook-originated (\"is_fb=true\")? If true, get the value of the ad group parameter. If the value contains the word \"bonus\", send the user to the \"bonus\" activity.",
      " Deferred deep linking In contrast to deep linking, deferred deep linking with SRNs is possible using the AppsFlyer GCD API.AppsFlyer receives the conversion data and makes it available to the app on the first launch.New users that install after clicking on a deep linking/retargeting campaign on an SRN can be redirected within the app upon launch, by using the conversion data. However, with SRNs, the regular AppsFlyer deep linking parameters are not present as part of the deep link data. To use this data within the app, the developer needs to employ further logic based on available parameters, such as campaign, ad set, or single ad names. Note: For Facebook, deferreddeep linking via GCD is available for Android apps using the Google Install Referrer mechanism. It isn't available for iOS apps.",
      "iOS implications Most SRNs support SKAdNetwork and have the necessary integration with AppsFlyer. iOS 14.5 SRN attribution Starting iOS 14.5, when users give ATT consent in both the advertiser and publisher apps (dual consent), SRN installs, which are recorded in the SKAdNetwork dashboard, are also shown in the traditional dashboards. Note The traditional dashboard shows a reduction in installs attributed to SRNs. When considering SRN performance, use the SKAdNetwork dashboard. Overall expect a decrease in SRN attributions of installs, with a matching increase in organic installs. The SKAdNetwork dashboard updates with a lag of 48-72 hours after installs. Installs brought by Apple Search Ads (ASA) aren't attributed in the SKAdNetwork dashboard.",
      " Sending event postbacks to SRNs SRNs receiving event postbacks rely on including the device ID in the postback. This enables SRNs to self-attribute reported user actions. Many iOS 14 users are non-consenting, meaning they don't allow access to their device ID (IDFA). In this case, you should expect: A decrease in the number of event postbacks sent to SRNs Discrepancies in the number of event postbacks between SRNs and AppsFlyer\u2014who log all events.",
      "Note AppsFlyer doesn't send postbacks for installs, app opens, or in-app events if there's no IDFA (except for this scenario in Google ads) Click ad networks are not affected, as they use their own transaction IDs, and not device IDs, to self-attribute event postback information.",
      " FAQ How does retargeting work with SRNs? Retargeting clicks from non-SRNs are easily identifiable by the existence of theis_retargeting=true parameter in the retargeting attribution link.With SRNs, there is no similar indication. Instead, to enable attributing re-engagements from SRNs, AppsFlyer uses another logic: Pre-requisites: On the App Settings page, turn on Enable retargeting. In the Integrated Partners page, select the SRN, and turn on Retargeting. With each app launch,AppsFlyer queries the SRN about recent engagements of the device ID with campaign ads for the app. If the SRN responds back with engagement details, AppsFlyer validates the engagement is within the lookback window and beyond the minimum time between re-engagements. Validated engagements are recorded as re-engagements and attributed to the SRN.",
      " What is SRN mistargeting? SRN campaigns should target a specific audience, but this doesn't always happen: Non-users in user-acquisition campaigns and existing users in retargeting campaigns. If one SRN is used to run both user acquisition and retargeting campaigns, this can lead to user mistargeting. As a result, you pay for unintended traffic. Scenario:An SRN in the AppsFlyer platform is enabled for a user-acquisition campaign. After each app launch, AppsFlyer queries the SRN to check if the advertising ID (user) had a recent engagement. If yes, SRN replies with the campaign name. AppsFlyer determines if it was the first launch (or not) and attributes accordingly:First launch: A new install is attributed to the campaign. Second or later launch: A retargeting event is attributed to the campaign.",
      "Conclusion: It is wasteful to get retargeting events from a user acquisition campaign. Is mistargeting a problem? AppsFlyer data analysts checked Facebook user acquisition campaigns during a given month. Retargeting was enabled. In 30% of campaigns, at least 15% of targeted users were existing app users. In 5% of campaigns, at least 40% were existing app users. Conclusion: In SRN user-acquisition campaigns, 1 in 10 targeted users is already an existing user. Solving the mistargeting problem Basic solution:Don't include existing app users in a user acquisition campaign. SRN will only target potential newusers. Maximizes new user acquisition results for the same budget. Periodically (and manually) update the campaign, for example, once a month. However, time gaps mean that existing users may be targeted in user-acquisition campaigns during the first month after they install an app. Audiences, an AppsFlyer premium feature, lets youautomatically send, on a daily basis, any segment of your user base to dozens of ad networks. AppsFlyer research shows that solving mistargeting can have a dramatic impact on your marketing and user acquisition efforts.",

      " Tip The Google Ads API integration automatically includes the Google Ads remarketing feature. By completing this integration and sending events to Google Ads you are able to create remarketing audience lists in Google Ads without any additional integrations. Granting permissions to Google Ads team members You can grant Google Ads permissions to access certain data in your account. You can do this in the Google Ads configuration page under the Permission tab for each one of your apps. To be able to get these permissions and access your app, your Google Ads representative should be a team member of Google Ads\u2019 partner account on Appsflyer. Because of Google\u2019s privacy requirements, Google can add new team members to its AppsFlyer partner account only when it\u2019s explicitly requested by an advertiser. In order to grant a Google Ads team member access to your app, do the following: Fill out and submit this form to request your account manager to be added to Google\u2019s partner account on AppsFlyer. Wait for the confirmation from Google Ads that your GA account manager has been added. Go to Configuration > Integrated partners > Google Ads > Permissions, and add your account manager email to the list of team members. Activate the permissions you wish to grant your Google Ads account manager. Read more about providing permissions to Ad networks. Enabling Google Ads attribution for agencies AppsFlyer supports agency configurations with Google Ads. It is essential that the advertiser and the agency have separate Google Ads accounts to enable AppsFlyer to correctly attribute the data. For details, click here. Running with multiple Google Ads accounts AppsFlyer supports working with multiple Google Ads accounts for the same app. This is performed through sharing the Link ID in Google Ads and importing the events into each Google Ads account. For further details on how to share your Google Ads Link ID, click here. iOS App Campaigns Note: This section applies to app campaigns for installs and not app campaigns for engagement. On January 27, 2021, Google announced policy updates to accommodate iOS 14 release. Since ATT enforcement began, Google iOS apps do not prompt for ATT, and therefore Google Ads products stopped using device identifiers (IDFA) that fall under ATT. To preserve reporting and campaign optimization, Google expanded modeled conversions to iOS 14+ traffic. Since modeled conversions are not reliant on device IDs, starting with the iOS14.5 release, the iOS install app campaign inventory logic employed by Google is as follows: iOS ACI search channel/inventory isn't attributed (per earlier January 24, 2020 policy). iOS ACI YouTube channel/inventory isn\u2019t attributed, since the YouTube app is not prompting ATT so IDFA cannot be used. iOS ACI Display channel/inventory can be attributed, only when a device ID is present, in case there is consent on both the advertiser and the publisher apps. Using deferred deep linking in App campaigns Google feeds in App campaigns enable you to create a smooth content-specific experience for new mobile users. When a potential user clicks on a feed, they are redirected to the app page. After the user installs the app and launches it, the SDK supplies the specific product details (e.g. running shoes) with deferred deep linking. The app developer uses this data to deliver the relevant user experience within the app. To enable deferred deep linking with Google Ads: Make sure to use GCD to receive the af_dp parameter in the AppsFlyer SDK. In Google, set up feeds. In AppsFlyer, Go to Configuration > Integrated Partners.Select Google Ads (Adwords). In the Integration tab, enable Deferred deep linking with Google Ads. Click Save integration. Google Ads parameter mapping The following table describes the parameter mapping between Google Ads and AppsFlyer.

Related reading |Incrementality guide Overview Incrementality testing measures the real impact of your campaigns with A/B testing that accurately measures \u201cincremental lift\u201d\u2014the difference between conversions that happened as a result of your remarketing campaigns, and those that would have happened anyway. The results are crucial for understanding the actual value generated by your marketing investments. With Incrementality testing, you can objectively see the impact of particular channels and campaigns and make better decisions about budget allocation and campaign optimization. AppsFlyer makes Incrementality testing easy with an automated process that begins at audience creation. The new audience is automatically split between connected media partners and a control group, via the enabled \u201cMeasure incremental impact\u201d toggle. The control group is the portion of the audience that is held back from partners and is an indispensable part of testing. Once the audience is saved, an Incrementality experiment is automatically created. After launching your campaigns on the partner side and linking the campaigns to the experiment, you\u2019ll be able to view the experiment results in the Incrementality dashboard. Get started Follow these steps to get started with Incrementality testing. For additional details about each step, see Set up the experiment below.",

      " Audience Describe the audience you are testing. Choose an audience you have already set up in AppsFlyer Audiences, or create a new one that meets your test criteria. Audience size Select an audience with a large user base and an event with high conversion rates. A large sample size is more likely to yield statistically significant results. Best practice: An audience of at least 50,000 users, split among 1-3 ad networks + the control group.",
      "Campaign Describe the campaign (messaging, incentives, etc.). Control group % The control group is automatically set to 15% of the audience size (best practice is between 15% to 25%). Test group Determine the ad networks you want to test. The split percentage will be divided equally between them (but you can adjust the percentage of the audience that will be sent to each). Best practice: 1-3 ad networks",
      "Hypothesis Define the expected outcome of the experiment. While it may feel somewhat counterintuitive to predict the outcome before you begin, setting out a hypothesis is an important element of experimental design; it's what helps you interpret your results. Best practice: State a hypothesis that is easily testable by using actual percentages as opposed to vague estimates. For example: 15% more users will purchase an upgradeis an easily testable hypothesis. Significantly more users will purchase an upgradeis more difficult to test.",
      "Example Using the guidelines described above, you might define an experiment that looks something like the following.",
      "Variables/Hypothesis Example",
      " Audience Users who completed registration but didn't make a purchase Audience size 100,000 Campaign A campaign that provides a discount voucher to users who make a purchase during a specified period Control group % 15% of the audience size Test group Send remaining audience members to: Network A (42% of audience) Network B (43% of audience)",
      " Hypothesis The rate of test group users who engage with the remarketing campaign and make a purchase will be 10% higher than users in the control group.",
      "Create the target audience and split groups After you have defined your objectives, the next step is to configure the audience you'll be testing: In AppsFlyer Audiences, create an audience (or you can or split an existing audience that meets the requirements of your experimental design.) In the Connect tab for the selected audience: Connect the audience to 1-3 ad network partners. Make sure the toggle that splits the audience is enabled (it's automatically enabled for Incrementality subscribers, on audiences created after January 11, 2023). If not, click the toggle to enable it. The control group is automatically set to 15% (recommended). The rest of the audience is automatically split evenly among your selected ad network partners. The total split percentage must equal 100% (including the control group).",
      " Once you have saved your audience with the split enabled, an Incrementality experiment is automatically launched (Incrementality subscribers only). These experiments can be viewed on the Incrementality dashboard with the prefix \"[Auto]\" before the title. Important notes: While the experiment is running, don't make any changes to the audience configuration. Changes to partners, audience name, or other settings will cause inaccurate statistical analysis.Best practice: Even after an experiment has ended, if you need to make changes to the definition of a previously-tested audience, duplicate the audience first and make changes to the new copy. This ensures the ongoing integrity of the historical data on the Incrementality dashboard. Modifying the split and partner configuration of an existing audience will end the current Incrementality experiment and create a new one. Both Facebook and Google Ads have an optional feature that enables campaigns to target outside a configured audience list in order to expand campaign reach. This feature, if left on, will bias Incrementality experiments and cause inaccurate results. Please verify that this feature is turned off. In Facebook, the feature is called \u201cAdvantage custom audience\u201d. It appears at the adset level and is enabled by default. In Google Ads, it\u2019s called \u201cAudience expansion\u201d.",
      " Launch the campaign and experiment Take the following actions: 1. Configure campaigns on ad networks The first step is to create a campaign that targets the users in your audience and launch it on the ad network side (for each ad network to which the audience is being uploaded). Important! In order to obtain accurate test results, configure the campaign so that it targets only users in the audience being tested; don't include users from any other source. If the tested audience is a newly-created audience, it can take up to 24 hours for the audience to be available on the ad network platform. 2. Link campaigns to experiment A new Incrementality experiment is automatically launched once a new audience is created with the split enabled (or if the toggle that splits the audience is newly enabled on an existing audience). However, you will need to link the experiment to the campaign(s) you wish to measure. To link the campaign to the experiment: 1. In Audiences, locate the specific audience, then click the + Link campaign status in the Incrementality column. The Link campaign to experiment window displays. 2. Select the relevant campaign(s) for each ad network. Note: The dropdown menu will be populated with campaigns pulled from your media partners. When the data is available, campaigns in the dropdown will be ordered by the likelihood of them being used to market to the specific audience. The top suggestion will be preselected for you. 3. Click Save. The campaign is now linked to the experiment. Manually create an experiment If you\u2019re an Incrementality subscriber who created your audience after January 11, 2023, there's no need to manually create an experiment. Experiments are automatically created for your audiences (and appear on the Incrementality dashboard with \"[Auto]\" before the title). If you wish to create a manual experiment on an older audience or for some other reason, follow these steps. To manually create a new Incrementality experiment: In AppsFlyer, go to Dashboards > Incrementality. From the Incrementality experiments page, click the New experiment button. Follow the steps in the wizard to create the experiment. Detailed instructions are provided as you go through each step. Notes Wizard step 2 \u2013 Audience setup In step 2 of the wizard, you are asked to select the date from which audience members should be included in the experiment. By default, this is the date on which the audience was initially split with a control group. To ensure accurate experiment results, you should change this date if either of the following situations applies: If you've made changes to the definition of the selected audience (audience segmentation rulesets, user identifier, etc.) \u2192 change this date to match the last date on which these audience definition changes were made. If you're testing a new campaign on a pre-existing audience \u2192 change this date to the date on which you launched the new campaign. Wizard step 3 \u2013 Set targets Here's where to select the target app and KPIs. Note: All other KPIs will be available at the end of the experiment, even if not selected. Wizard step 4 \u2013 Review In step 4 of the wizard, you are asked to set the experiment period. By default, an experiment is set to run for 30 days from the time it is created. This is the minimum recommended period for running an experiment. Select the Continue experiment indefinitely option if you wish to let the experiment continue running until you actively choose to end it.",

      "Data storage architecture Overview The structure of your data in storage depends if the data is sent to cloud storage or a data warehouse. The folder structure described here applies to storage (buckets). In the case of data warehouse storage (Snowflake) consider that the reference to folders applies to views. See Snowflake. Data is written to your selected storage option. In the case of cloud storage, the storage is owned by AppsFlyer on AWS or owned by you on AWS or GCS. You can switch storage options at any time or send some or all of your data to multiple storage options. Data in the storage is organized in a hierarchical folder structure, according to report type, date, and time. The following figure contains an example of this structure: Data of a given report is contained in the hour (h) folders associated with that report: The number of hour folders depends on the report data freshness (hourly, daily or versioned). Data is provided in GZ compressed files having Parquet or CSV format. Data files consist of columns (fields). The schema (field) structure of the user journey reports is identical and depends on the fields selected by you. Other reports each have their own explicit fields, AKA schemaless reports. See Data Locker marketer reports for the reports available and links to the report specifications.",

      "The top-level folder in the bucket depends on the storage owner and provider. In general, the top-level folder is your Subscription ID but in some cases, for example, if you use Cyberduck the ID is set in the bookmark and doesn't display in the folder structure. The data-locker-hourly folder contains the report topics. Folders above this level depend on bucket ownership and cloud service provider. Examples of folder structure based on bucket owner and cloud provider AppsFlyer bucket: <af-ext-reports>/<unique_identifier>/<data-locker-hourly> Your AWS bucket: <af-datalocker-your bucket prefix>/<generated-home-folder><subscription-id> Your GCS bucket: <your bucket name>/<generated-home-folder>/<subscription-id>",
      " Topic (t) Report type relates to the subject matter of the report. Date (dt) This is the related data date. In the case of raw data, it means the date the event occurred. In the case of aggregated data, the reporting date itself.",
      "Time (h or version) Date folders are divided into hourly (h) or version folders depending on the report type. Hourly folders The h folders relate to the time the data was received by AppsFlyer. For example, install events received between 14:00-15:00 UTC are written to the h=14 file. Note! There is a delay, of about 1-3 hours, between the time the data arrives in AppsFlyer until the h folder is written to Data Locker. For example, the h=14 folder is written 1 hour later at 15:00 UTC. Hourly folder characteristics: There are 24 h folders numbered 0\u201323. For example, h=0, h=1, and so on. A late folder, h=late, contains events of the preceding day arriving after midnight. Meaning events arriving during 00:00\u201302:00 UTC of the following day. For example, if a user installs an app on Monday 08:00 UTC and the event arrives on Tuesday 01:00 UTC, the event is written to Monday's late folder. Data arriving after 02:00 UTC is written to the folder of the actual arrival date and time. Ensure that data in the h=late folder is consumed. It isn't contained in any other folder. _temporary folder: In some cases, we generate a temporary folder within an h folder. Disregard temporary folders and subfolders. Example: /t=impressions/dt=2021-04-11/h=18/_temporary. Note: Raw data reports having a daily data freshness are stored in the h=23 folder. The uninstall report is usually in the h=2 folder but can be in any folder. Cohort and Incrementality reports are stored directly in the dt folder. Versioned reports adhere to a different convention described in this section.",
      "Hourly report considerations for apps that don't use UTC time. To make sure that you get all the data for a given calendar day you must consume the folders according to the day defined by the app timezone as detailed: Eastern hemisphere timezone: To get all the data of a given calendar date you must consume folders according to UTC time and date. Example: Your app timezone is UTC+10 (Sydney, Australia). To get all the hourly data related to tuesday (Sydney) you must consume the following folders: Monday h=14\u201323 and late, Tuesday h=0\u201313 and 14-15 Why must you consume Tuesday h=14-15? Some data can arrive late. So the h=14\u201315 folders can contain late-arriving events. You must filter event_time to align with the app calendar day relative to UTC. Western hemisphere timezone: To get all the data of a given calendar date you must consume folders according to UTC time and date. Example: Your app timezone is UTC- 7 (Los Angeles). To get all the hourly data related to Tuesday (Los Angeles) you must consume the following folders: Tuesday h=7\u201323 and late, Wednesday h=0\u20136 and 7-8. Why must you consume Wednesday h=7-8? Some data can arrive late. So the h=7\u20138 folders can contain late-arriving events. You must filter event_time to align with the app calendar day relative to UTC. Version folders Some reports have a versioned option. This means that the most updated data for a given day is provided multiple times. Because data can continue to update due to late-arriving data or more accurate data the same report has multiple versions where the most recent version is the most accurate. The reports for a given day are contained in the versions folder of that day. Each version is contained in a separate folder whose name is set using an Epoch timestamp that uniquely identifies the report. Your data import processes must consider that data can be written retroactively. For example, on January 14, data can be written to the Jan 1 folder. If the bucket is owned by you, consider using cloud service notification to trigger your import process (AWS| GCS)",

This results in the advertiser seeing incomplete cost data. Make sure the agency user who logs into the Cost tab has access to the Google ads customer ID set up in the Integration tab. Using spaces or special characters in iOS Search or Android Landing Page campaigns may cause issues with matching cost data to click data and leading to missing cost reporting.

      "Can AppsFlyer show the campaign level and ad groups? Yes. In fact, AppsFlyer shows you also the single ad level, so you have 3 levels of drill down with Facebook Ads, campaigns >> ad groups >> ads. Is Facebook data shown in real-time? Yes, all installs and subsequent in-app events are shown in real-time. However, the clicks, impressions, and cost data AppsFlyer gets in an aggregated form from Facebook arrives periodically every few hours. When can I see a new campaign's data on AppsFlyer? To see data from new ads, ad sets and campaigns on Facebook they must generate at least one install. For example, a new ad has generated 100 clicks with no installs, and is not shown on the AppsFlyer dashboard and data. Another ad only has 1 click and 1 install, but is displayed on AppsFlyer.",

Do you make Facebook raw data available to agencies?

Can I use OneLink with the Facebook mobile app install objective? Facebook has various advertising objectives to choose from when you run ads for an app: App installs, traffic, and conversions. For most objectives, like traffic or conversions, OneLink links or other third-party links are accepted. However, for the app install objective, Facebook only accepts Facebook App Links for deep linking.",

As AppsFlyer gets only aggregated click and impression data from Facebook, the entire set of raw clicks and impressions is not available. The only raw clicks and impressions available in raw reports are those that resulted in installs.",
      "Are there limitations of Facebook cost data by geo? If you filter by Geo on AppsFlyer's dashboard, you can see the summary and breakdown of the Facebook cost data. This data is available only for \"Mobile App Install Campaigns\" on Facebook. In addition, cost by Geo data is only available for single platform campaigns. This means campaigns that have an Android-targeted ad set, and an iOS-targeted ad set, can't have Geo-specific cost data. To get the full cost data, dedicate a campaign to each platform.",
      "What are the limitations of Facebook cost data in Master API? Facebook doesn\u2019t support grouping of cost data by Geo and Channel simultaneously in Master API reports. To create a report with complete cost data, group it by only one of these dimensions.",
      "The total cost doesn't match There are differences between Facebook and AppsFlyer attribution models. These differences may lead to discrepancies with Facebook cost data: Facebook cross-device attribution:this might sometimes cause issues where a campaign for one platform (iOS/Android) shows an install with its cost for another platform. Facebook non-mobile campaigns: inthese campaigns, like Facebook's link click campaigns, desktop users may eventually install mobile apps. For these cross-device campaigns, AppsFlyer does not show cost. However, if the link click was performed by the same device that installed the app, cost data is received.For example, a Facebook user clicks on an ad leading to the advertiser's landing page on a desktop computer. A week later the same Facebook user installs the advertiser's iOS app on an iPhone device. While the install is attributed and displayed on AppsFlyer's dashboard, the cost of this cross-platform install is not. Campaigns with 0 results in the last 7 days - AppsFlyer syncs the cost only for campaigns that had installs/conversions in the past 7 days. If Facebook cost was just set, campaigns which were inactive for more than 7 days beforehand will not show cost.",
      " Why is the AppsFlyer calculation for eCPI different from the cost calculated by Facebook, while the total cost is identical? The Cost Per Install is calculated by dividing the total cost with the number of installs. Since AppsFlyer counts installs differently from Facebook the eCPI will usually differ between the two.",
      "Why doesn't cost data include data from all campaigns? When a user performing the Facebook login (described above) doesn't have access in Facebook to some of the running campaigns, the result is campaigns that are displayed on AppsFlyer's dashboard but lack some of the cost, clicks, and impression data. Note: Although several Facebook users may have permission to run campaigns in the Facebook Business Manager, only one is required to perform the Facebook login.",

      "Why is there a discrepancy in cost data for apps in the Amazon app store? Contrary to AppsFlyer's data, Facebook doesn't distinguish between cost data from Android apps as opposed to Amazon apps\u2014which are Android-based. Therefore, the cost data of Amazon users may be attributed to campaigns targeting other Android users instead of the original Amazon campaigns.",
      "How to connect cost data ofa new Facebook ad account while my old account is linked? If you want to switch to a new Facebook ad account but your Facebook cost is already linked via AppsFlyer with your old ad account, you need to disconnect the ad account via Facebook and connect the new ad account in AppsFlyer. On Facebook, go to Settings > Business Integration. On the Active tab, remove the AppsFlyer integration. Go to AppsFlyer dashboard and connect the cost with the new ad account.",
      " Facebook Ads SDK FAQ Who needs Facebook's SDK? Your app may already have the Facebook SDK integrated into it, before the AppsFlyer SDK. Even if not, you may wonder whether you really need Facebook SDK in addition to AppsFlyer SDK. And if you do, can the two co-exist without duplicate reporting? Your app does not require the Facebook SDK for the following: User acquisition: Generally, the AppsFlyer SDKtakes care of all mobile user acquisition attribution purposes of your Facebook users, including engagements, installs, sessions, and post-install events. Deep linking: To open the app when the link is clicked and deep link users to a specific page or activity in the app, you can use OneLink, without the Facebook SDK. However, you need a URI scheme configured to open the app (Universal Links and Android App Links do not work). Facebook scrapes the OneLink URL, and uses it to create a Facebook App Link that opens the app, and deep links the user. Your app requires the Facebook SDK in addition to the AppsFlyer SDK for the following: Deferred deep linking:Currently, it's only possible to access Facebook DDL data via the Conversion data legacy method. For both iOS and Android apps, the Facebook SDK is required to make this data available in the Conversion data method. However, in Android and Google Play only, it's possible to perform deferred deep linking using the Google Install Referrer mechanism.",
      "Dynamic Product Ads campaigns data: You can only get data for Dynamic Product Ads from the Facebook SDK. Other Facebook features: You may need Facebook SDK for reasons unrelated to attribution such as authentication, ad monetization, social sharing, user invites, etc.",
      "Note The above information and recommendations regarding deep linking and deferred deep linking are based on thorough testing we conducted using Facebook\u2019s available demo/preview tools, which uses a different mechanism than live ads.",
      " Avoiding duplicates with Facebook SDK If you have both SDKs in your app, install and in-app events are reported to Facebook SDK, and then via postbacks to Facebook servers through AppsFlyer. How can you avoid this duplicate reporting? Installs: Facebook de-duplicates app installs. If both Facebook SDK and AppsFlyer report on a new user installing a mobile app, Facebook knows to count this install only once. In cases when Facebook Ads SDK is initialized at the app launch, before the AppsFlyer SDK, the install is recorded only by Facebook Ads and not by AppsFlyer. Verify that the AppsFlyer SDK is initialized at app launch, before the Facebook Ads SDK. In-app events: Facebook does not de-duplicate in-app events, which are reported from both its SDK methods as well as from another source, i.e. AppsFlyer. This means that, unless taken care of, Facebook may report double revenue and other events, falsely. Use either of these possible methods to avoid duplicate in-app event reporting in Facebook: Don't configure events in the Facebook SDK. For Android - disable the Facebook in-app events mapping from AppsFlyer.Note that to enable SKAN attribution for iOS 14.5+, you'll need to map in-app events to Facebook Ads.",
      " Facebook Ads attribution FAQ Attributing agencies with Facebook Agencies and FMPs can run and attribute Facebook campaigns on behalf of advertisers on AppsFlyer, or even alongside the advertisers' own Facebook campaigns. In order for the agency campaigns to be attributed to the agency, the campaign name MUST begin with the agency's name. Note that for iOS 14 users, only one agency can run campaigns for a specific ad account. See more about Facebook Ads and AppsFlyer SKAdNetwork interoperability. For more details about agencies and Facebook install attribution please go here. In addition, agencies can't alter Facebook lookback windows and retargeting control. Rather, they need to ask the advertiser to perform these changes if they're needed. Besides, agencies cannot modify any in-app event postbacks sent to Facebook. The reason for that is Facebook's requirement to receive information about all installs, including those that are not attributed to it (and therefore may not be brought by the agency). The image below shows all settings that need to be configured by the advertiser for the agency to be able to manage its Facebook campaigns: ",
      "Attribution for Facebook for out-of-store Android apps Facebook doesn't allow creating mobile apps install campaigns for Android apps that are in out-of-store markets, for example, Baidu. However, you can advertise and record installs for out-of-store apps on Facebook following these instructions: The developer has to prepare a separate APK for each out-of-store market you use to advertise your app on. More details here. Create a Traffic or Conversions campaign on Facebook, with mobile attribution enabled, which sends leads to a landing page. The landing page should include a Download App button, which directly links to the out-of-store market where the APK exists. The lead clicks on the button and is redirected to the out-of-store market. After completing the installation AppsFlyer attributes the user to Facebook, via its MMP API.",
      "Note The same solution applies to apps in Google Play and the App store, which require a landing page prior to the redirection to the market. For specific instructions on attribution for apps in Amazon on Facebook, click here.",
      "What is Facebook Android and iOS cross-attribution? Facebook identifies users based on their Facebook account. Some users have both iOS and Android devices associated with the same Facebook account. If such a user clicks or views an ad for your app on their Android device, but install the app on their iOS device, Facebook considers themselves as having generated the install. As a result, an Android Campaign name appears on your iOS dashboard. Example Andrew Josef is busy on his Android device. While using it, he clicks on an Android Facebook campaign ad for an app called Bubbles. He does not download the app.One day later, Andrew Josef decides to download the Bubbles app organically on his iOS device and launches it.In this situation, AppsFlyer attribution takes the Android Facebook campaign from Facebook and presents it in the iOS Dashboard where Andrew Josef downloaded and launched it from.",
      " What are Facebook Ads channels? With Facebook you can see data broken down not only by campaigns, ad sets and ads, but also by Facebook channels (called Placements on Facebook). Facebook channel - users from the Facebook app Instagram - users from the Instagram app Messenger - users from the Facebook Messenger app AudienceNetwork - users from other apps that belong to or are affiliated with Facebook Use this data to compare the quality of users that you get from the different channels of Facebook."

      "Note Canvas was previously used to refer to Facebook platform apps (usually games that you can play inside the desktop Facebook frame). Like any ad type on Facebook, we can attribute mobile app installs that occur following a click or impression, so long as the advertiser opts-in. Setting up canvas ads Setting up canvas ads is not an obvious process, as the flow takes place in two different interfaces from within Facebook, and requires some configuration in the campaign set-up. First, the canvas unit must be set up on Facebook page. The advertiser must be logged into a Facebook account with access to the Page. 1. From the Facebook page, go to Publishing Tools >> Canvas: 2. From here create a canvas unit and set up text, media, and destination: Some of the elements, such as photo and button, allow the advertiser to add a click-through destination. 3. Enter your app store URL: Once the canvas unit is saved and finished, go to the Facebook Power Editor as usual and create the ad, set the targeting, and any other parameters you need. (Alternatively, go to your FMP tool - for which the instructions vary, so this should be checked with your FMP). In the Power Editor, create a campaign with either the Traffic or Brand Awareness objective. Note The Mobile App Install objective is not compatible with canvas units! 5. On the Ad Set set up, uncheck all placements apart from Feeds. Canvas units cannot be placed on Instagram, Audience Network, or any other location: 6. On the Ad setup, associate the ad with the correct mobile app: You can now attribute users who install the app from these ads."

    "title": "Disabling postbacks for CPA-based campaigns",
    "answers": [
      "At a glance: Prevent install postbacks and send only specific in-app event (for example, purchase) postback to ad networks to effectively run CPA campaigns. Introduction When you run a CPA (cost-per-action) mobile campaign, ad networks can use mapped in-app event postbacks for charging, instead of the standard install postbacks. However, some networks require getting ONLY the specific in-app event postback (e.g. purchase) to effectively run a CPA campaign. These networks wish to prevent install postbacks, but still need to receive postbacks for specific in-app events. By adding a simple parameter on AppsFlyer attribution links this can be easily achieved. Note that installs, that come from these attribution links, are still attributed, aggregated, and presented normally in AppsFlyer dashboards and data. If according to your agreement with the ad network you are charged for actions only within a certain period after an install, you can also disable postbacks after this period. This article explains how to disable postbacks in both cases. Important! Disabling install postbacks can cause serious reconciliation problems between advertisers and ad networks if not agreed upon in advance. Advertisers and ad networks MUST have consent from one another BEFORE starting to disable postbacks. Preventing Install Postbacks Add af_installpostback=false as an additional parameter on the link to disable the install postbacks. Example Installs coming from the link below do not result in install postbacks: http://app.appsflyer.com/com.myapp?pid=network_int&af_installpostback=false&clickid={clickid}& For a list of AppsFlyer's available attribution links macros go here. Who Can Disable Install Postbacks? Since disabling install postbacks entails but a simple addition on the attribution link, it can be added by either the advertiser or the ad network. SRNs, which don't use external attribution links, can't use the af_installpostback parameter, and therefore can't disable install postbacks. Effects of Disabling an Install Postback No postback to the attributed media source No postback to third party analytic networks such as Mixpanel, Localytics, or Amplitude (full list of 3rd Party Analytic Partners here) No postback to All-Installs networks Noraw data installation postback Disabling in-app event postbacks Depending on your agreement with the network, you may be charged for the conversions that happen only within a certain period of time after an install, re-install, or re-engagement. In this case, after this period, postbacks become irrelevant. For some networks, postbacks can be disabled in AppsFlyer Dashboard. In such cases, an in-app event postback window slider displays in the Partner Integration tab: To set up the window: Select the time unit (Hours, Days, Months, Lifetime) Use the slider to set the lookback window In-app event postbacks are not sent to the ad network past the lookback window. Postbacks are not sent past the lookback window and the network is not notified, but the events arestill recorded in AppsFlyer and attributed to the network.

      "At a glance: Learn how postback retries work in AppsFlyer and how integrated partners can configure their postback mechanisms. Introduction Postbacks to partners are a critical part of the integration between AppsFlyer and our partners. Since any system can experience momentary issues in its responsiveness, AppsFlyer is able to retry failed postbacks. Important information When does AppsFlyer retry a failed postback? A postback is retried when the response indicates an error on the receiving server-side 5XX errors.",
      "How often does AppsFlyer retry a failed postback? The first failed postback is retried up to four additional times in 15-minute intervals. In total, a single postback can be sent up to five times. Can retried postbacks be identified in postback reports? The raw data Postback report: \"Postback Retry\". The first postback sent has a blank value in this column. Any retried postback contains the value TRUE in this column. How can a partner identify the total eventual failed postbacks in the Postback report? A postback that has four TRUE values listed in the \"Postback Retry\" column and also contains error codes in the Postback HTTP Response Code is a postback that has entirely failed to have been sent to the partner. Is there anything special a partner should consider about retried postbacks? If the postback has reached your system and has been processed successfully, but there was an error or delay in sending a response\u2014this is considered a failed postback, and retries are sent after 15 minutes. This can cause duplication on the partner's end. The partner must implement a deduplication mechanism on their end. Are postback retries automatically enabled for all partners? No. If a partner wants to retry failed postbacks, they should reach out to their PDM to enable this feature."

      "At a glance: Increase the efficiency of your user acquisition and remarketing campaigns by using AppsFlyer Audiences to build and connect audience segments to your partner networks. Related articles: Audiences partners | User Attributes | Import audience | Incrementality guide Audiences basics AppsFlyer Audiences lets you easily build audience segments and connect them to your owned and paid media partners so you can deliver tailored messaging\u2014for better user experience, marketing performance, and conversion rates. An audience is a segment of current or past users of your app that meet the specific criteria that you define. Audiences can be based on personal characteristics, behavior, in-app activity, attribution source, revenue generated, geographic location, device type, and more. Step 1 - Build your audience in AppsFlyer: You can build a custom audience from scratch, import one, or select from our ready-made, fully customizable list of \u201cSuggested Audiences\u201d (Beta), which save you time and are based on industry best practices. Step 2 - Connect the audience: Once you\u2019ve built your audience, the next step is connecting it to your media partners from within AppsFlyer, which sends identifiers for the members of that audience to the partners and creates the audience on the partners\u2019 systems. This enables them to serve specific ads only to these users. Audiences are automatically refreshed and pushed to partners once daily. Additionally, you can upload an audience to 3rd-party services such as Amazon S3 buckets, or download it as a CSV file right from the dashboard. All the information needed to upload audience data to a media partner is specified in a partner connection. You can have multiple connections for a single media partner (using different accounts, login information, etc.). Note on privacy In order to enable compliance with the privacy requirements of iOS 14.5 and other user privacy considerations, Audiences allows you full control to determine which identifiers are shared with partners, both at the account level and for each partner connection. Audience split and Incrementality testing Incrementality testing measures the real impact of your campaigns with A/B testing that accurately measures \u201cincremental lift\u201d\u2014the difference between conversions that happened as a result of your marketing campaigns and those that would have happened anyway.

The audience can be used to re-engage these users with personalized messaging on either owned or paid media, or as an exclusion list to prevent them from seeing irrelevant or unnecessary ads when running campaigns. Example: Remarketing Using clicks and views for effective remarketing. To convert these users, a little extra convincing or a gentle reminder is needed. These users have a high probability of converting so remarketing to them can produce significantly better results than advertising to new segments. Create precise audiences for remarketing based on clicks and impressions data collected. Build an audience of potential users that clicked on an ad but did not install in the last two days. These are users who, in the recent past, were sufficiently interested in your mobile app to click on your ad, but for some reason did not install the app, or installed the app but did not launch it.

The redirect method has the following advantages: Increased advertiser trust: The MMP acts on behalf of an advertiser. By providing AppsFlyer access to the postback firsthand, advertisers are confident that postbacks are not manipulated in transit. No processing required by the ad network: Ad networks respond with the redirect command (to the device), thus eliminating the need to process postbacks.

      " Social media preview - OG tags When a link is shared, open graph (OG) tags are used to generate a preview with a title, description, and image. These OG tags may automatically be taken from the web URL or app store you are redirecting to. However, sometimes this method of generating a preview fails. Therefore, we recommend setting your social media previews in OneLink, either using the OneLink UI, or, for links not created in the OneLink UI, by adding OG tag parameters to your link. The Social media preview feature is supported by the following platforms: Facebook (posts and DMs) Twitter (posts and DMs) iMessage WhatsApp LinkedIn (posts and DMs) Line Telegram Slack Signal KakaoTalk Discord Reddit To create your own social media preview in the OneLink UI: In your OneLink custom link editor, go to theShare on social media section.

      " Social app landing page Social media apps may break the smooth experience of existing users using Universal Links. This can be overcome by: [Recommended] Creating a social app landing page.When creating a social media app landing page, we recommend making sure you have a URI scheme configured. [Alternative] Forcing the app to open using the af_force_deeplink=true parameter.Note: This parameter is automatically enabled for Kakaotalk, Naver, Naver-Blog, Chrome, Weibo, and Twitter. With a social app landing page, users who click ads in social media apps are redirected to an AppsFlyer-generated landing page. From there, they can be deep linked, or continue to install the app. AppsFlyer provides a variety of social app landing page templates. Element positions in the templates are fixed, but the elements themselves are customizable, including background image or color, titles, texts, images, buttons, tags, and more. The social app landing page can be used with the following social media apps: Instagram Facebook/Facebook Messenger (Note: For Facebook and Facebook Messenger, if both URI scheme and a Social app landing page are set up, the Social app landing page doesn't display.) LinkedIn Pinterest for iOS Snapchat Twitter WeChat User experience When the user engages with the CTA button in the landing page: If app is installed: the clicking user launches the app. If app is NOT installed: the user is taken to the relevant app store. Upon install, it's possible to defer deep linking the user (explained in deep linking and deferred deep linking). Note The social app landing page only supports OneLink short URL. To use the social app landing page: Configure the landing page as described in the following section.

      " Deep linking and deferred deep linking Deep linking means you retarget your existing app users and send them directly into a specific experience (for example, a specific page) within your app, without being directed to the app store or app home page first. These users are attributed using retargeting attribution. Deferred deep linking means you give new users a similar deep linking experience as existing users. But their user flow is that first, new users are sent to the app store, and after they download and launch the app, they are sent to the specific experience or page. Note: Setting up deep linking and deferred deep linking requires your Android and iOS developers. To set up deep linking and deferred deep linking to direct users to a specific experience in the app: Contact your iOS and Android developers to plan thedeep_link_valueto set on your links. Thedeep_link_valueis the value name for the specific in-app content that users will be directed to. The developers implement the desired behavior of the deep_link_value in the code. The developers implement the desired behavior in the code. Share the guide so they understand the technical flow and see examples: Unified deep linking (UDL) for AndroidandiOS: For deep linking AND deferred deep linking new or existing users, with or without your app.Considerations for UDL: Requires SDK V6.1 or later. Click lookback window can be up to 15 minutes.",
      "Note: Customers already using OneLink for deep linking may be using the legacy methods for Android and iOS, instead of UDL. Tips The deep_link_value can be based on a product SKU, social media post ID, URL path, or any other value. It is important to work with your developers to come up with the best long-term system for the deep_link_value and any other parameters or values. This will minimize additional app updates. Speak to your developer about the use of dynamic values, togenerate many different deep links that go to different content within the app, without needing to change the app code every time. For example, the deep_link_value of a fruit type was chosen and the developers made the values dynamic. This means you can enter any fruit without the need for further work by your dev team. https://onelink-sample-app.onelink.me/H5hv?pid=Email&c=fruit_of_the_month&deep_link_value=apples... https://onelink-sample-app.onelink.me/H5hv?pid=Email&c=fruit_of_the_month&deep_link_value=bananas... https://onelink-sample-app.onelink.me/H5hv?pid=Email&c=fruit_of_the_month&deep_link_value=peaches...",

      "Deferred deep linking with iOS Private Relay With the launch of iOS 15, Apple provides iCloud+ users with a feature calledPrivate Relay, which gives them the option to encrypt their web-browsing traffic and hide their exact location, IP address, and the contents of their browsing traffic. If users opt-in to Private Relay, this could interfere with attribution and deferred deep linking. Meaning, once a new user without the app goes to the App Store, and installs and launches the app, Private Relay could prevent them from being sent to a specific page in the app. To ensure that deferred deep linking (DDL) continues to work as expected, you need to implement one of the following AppsFlyer solutions: [Recommended] App Clip-based solution: Create an App Clip that gives you user attribution data, and directs users to a customized App Clip experience similar to the one you want DDL to achieve. The app clip can also include a flow to direct users from your App Clip to your full app. Clipboard-based solution: Create a web landing page that copies the deferred deep linking data from the URL and correctly redirects the user to the app. Note: This solution does not help with attribution.",
      "App Clip-based solution This solution combines OneLink short URLs with the App Clips technology available on iOS, and allows you to send users to specific flows in your product without the need to install the full app. The OneLink short URL gives you user attribution data, and directs users to a customized App Clip experience similar to the one you want DDL to achieve. The app clip can also include a flow to direct users from your App Clip to your full app. Note: If users reinstall the full app from the App Clip-based solution, it may be reported in AppsFlyer as an organic install. Flow The flow of the App Clip-based DDL solution is as follows: The advertiser creates an App Clip and adds it to a OneLink template for users with Private Relay turned on. The user taps the OneLink URL. AppsFlyer web handler checks whether the: Device is using iOS 15+ Browser is Safari User has Private Relay turned on. Once AppsFlyer confirms the above, and the user is prompted to either click Play App Clip or View in Safari. If the user clicks Play App Clip, an App Clip card displays to the user. If the user clicks View in Safari, a landing page opens, prompting them to open the App Clip. The user opens the App Clip. The App Clip opens and provides the user with the experience decided by the app marketer and developer. If the App Clip includes a flow to direct users to the full app, the users are sent to the App Store to download the full app. Upon app launch, they get the user experience defined by the developer. Prerequisites:AppsFlyer SDK V6.4.0+ To set up the App Clip-based DDL solution: Tell the developer to follow the App Clip-based solution dev hub instructions. and create an App Clip that provides the desired user experience. This can also include a flow to direct users from your App Clip to your full app. Create or edit a OneLink template withUniversal Linksand deferred deep linking. In the OneLink template, turn on Display App Clip if user has Private Relay. Don't turn this on unless you have an App Clip.Note: When making changes to a OneLink template with Universal Links, such as adding (or removing) App Clip capability, it may take several hours for the AASA file to update. Therefore, the links you create based on the template may not have the updated functionality right away. Create a custom link based on the OneLink template. In App Store Connect, go to the App Clip Experience section, scroll down to App URLs, and enter either your OneLink template URL (domain + template ID. For example: yourbrand.onelink.me/GrbZ), or a specific OneLink custom link short URL.Note: If you enter a OneLink custom link, the App Clip-based solution will only work for users tapping that specific link; other links created based off the OneLink template will not work.",
      " Clipboard-based solution Flow The flow of the clipboard-based DDL solution is as follows: The advertiser creates a deferred deep link that contains the parameter af_cp_lp=true. The user taps the deferred deep link. AppsFlyer checks whether the: Device is using iOS 15+ Browser is Safari User has Private Relay turned on. Link contains the parameter af_cp_lp=true. Once AppsFlyer confirms the above, the web landing page loads, containing the app icon, image, and a CTA to get the app from the App Store. The user also sees a message that explains the process: that the URL is copied to ensure the best user experience that will send them to the specific page in the app. The user taps Get the app. The user is sent to the App Store to install the app. Then, at first launch, they are sent to the specific app page.

      " Additional information Examples Basic example Mark is the marketer of a successful grocery delivery service called \"Feed Me.\" Mark targets his user-base phone numbers to download Feed Me's new mobile iOS and Android apps. An SMS campaign is planned. However, Mark doesn't know which users have Android or iOS devices. He also doesn't know whether or not they have the app installed. To solve this, Mark sends users an SMS containing a short URL powered by OneLink. When users receive the SMS and click the link: If they don\u2019t have the app yet, it automatically directs them to the appropriate app store or landing page, where it's easy for them to install the app. If they already have the app installed, the app opens for them. The new installs and re-engagements are attributed to the SMS campaign, enabling Mark to check the success of the SMS campaign in AppsFlyer. Deep linking example Mark the marketer's SMS (from the previous example) had mild success in getting users to download and open the app. However, not many users who clicked the link and opened the app converted to place an order. Mark decides to increase conversion by offering a free bag of peaches, apples, or avocados with every purchase. For this, Mark creates a smooth, deep-linking experience for existing users.

    "answers": [
      "At a glance: Automatically validate and measure revenue from in-app purchases and auto-renewable subscriptions to get the full picture of your customers' life cycles and accurate ROAS measurements. Overview Advertisers can use validated in-app purchases (IAP) and subscription revenue to measure: All revenue from in-app purchases of products and subscriptions managed through either App Store Connect (iOS) or Google Play Console (Android). Refunds. Pending and deferred transaction revenue (Android). Subscription-related events that happen inside or outside your app. The IAP and subscription revenue solution also: Makes sure no duplicate transactions are recorded. For iOS, this also can also ensure that no duplications are recorded for family sharing. Allows AppsFlyer to forward Apple App Store transactions to the advertiser. Provides True Revenue data, meaning net revenue data that takes into account store commission and taxes. The purchase and subscription data originates from: The AppsFlyer purchase SDK connector for Android and iOS (Unity wrapper included). App Store and Google Play (RTDN) server notifications sent to AppsFlyer. Purchase and subscription revenue data is available via AppsFlyer dashboards and reports. They can also be shared with partners via postbacks. Considerations: If you use this IAP and subscription revenue measurement solution, you shouldn\u2019t send in-app purchases eventsor execute validateAndLogInAppPurchase, as doing so results in duplicate revenue being reported. Subscription revenue is able to start recording subscriber life cycle changes for existing subscribers as soon as they launch an app version that includes the purchase SDK connector. Flow: A user makes an in-app purchase or auto-renewable subscription. The app makes a transaction in the app store. The AppsFlyer purchase SDK connector automatically detects the purchase and sends its payload to AppsFlyer for validation and logging. AppsFlyer validates the purchase with the relevant store to ensure it's not fraudulent. Upon successful validation, AppsFlyer logs the purchase or subscription. If receipt validation fails, the event displays in the blocked in-app events raw data report (available to Protect360 subscribers).",
      "AppsFlyer transfers the response to the SDK connector, which in turn transfers the receipt validation response (success or fail) to the app. Any incoming server notifications are also processed by the AppsFlyer purchase and subscription revenue business logic. Notifications regarding transactions previously reported via the SDK connector are validated and processed, and result in the internal creation of a purchase or life cycle event.

Starting February 1, 2023 all traffic initiated from Chrome 110-based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Opera and more) on Android or desktop devices reduces user-agent header data. Complete data is only available on request.",
      " Effective date February 1, 2023",
      " Action required",
      "For clicks and impressions reported via the user device, no action is required. AppsFlyer has already made necessary adaptations to comply with these changes and retrieves the complete data as required. For clicks and impressions reported by the ad network via serve-to-server, ad networks must use the Client Hints API to request the OS version and device model, and report them to AppsFlyer as parameters included in the attribution link. See ad network instructions",
      " What this impacts Attribution: No impact; attribution is unaffected as long as the actions required described above are taken. Dashboards: No impact Raw data reports: Clicks and impressions reports via Data Locker display the user-agent as it's received, with either full or reduced data. This means if the user-agent was reduced, the OS version and device model only display as separate fields and can't be extracted from the user-agent field itself."

      "Putting it all together\u2014a dashboard example The following example demonstrates some of the capabilities of the Predict dashboard and how you can use these capabilities to efficiently analyze your data and take meaningful action. Example Let's say you are a UA manager responsible for running campaigns in the UK, and you want to look at the predicted quality of users being driven by the campaigns you started last week. The main KPI you use to evaluate campaign performance is ROAS. Using the filter bar, you set the date range to display the data for installs during the past 7 days, and you set the geo filter to display only data for the UK. In addition to your new campaigns, you have many ongoing campaigns. For the moment, you want to focus only on the campaigns you started running last week, so you use the campaign filter to select only these campaigns. You change the data visualization options to show the pROAS KPI. For now, you keep the other options set to the default values (Dimension = media source; Characteristics = campaign and media source) This means each row represents a media source and each bubble on the row represents a cohort of users attributed to the same media source and campaign. Even with the filters you've applied, there are lots of small bubbles that make it harder to analyze your data, so you change the minimum cohort size to 50. This allows you to focus only on the largest cohorts. You notice that there are several bubbles on the left side of the distribution, meaning that they have low pROAS in comparison to other cohorts. You decide that you want to concentrate now on only those cohorts with pROAS of less than 100%, so you slide the right endpoint of the value filter down to 100%. You want to understand if there are specific site IDs that are pulling down the pROAS, so you change the characteristics selected in the data visualization options. You remove the campaign characteristic and add site ID instead. After this change, each row still represents a media source, but now each bubble represents a cohort of users attributed to the same media source and site ID. With the revised view, you quickly see that it's just a few site IDs that have low pROAS. When you click on these bubbles, the KPIs in the bubble details panel show that these cohorts actually have decent pARPU. The low pROAS is caused primarily by the high cost of acquiring these users (eCPI). To further analyze all the data, you scroll down to the results table set the grouping options to show media source > campaign > site ID. You download the table as a CSV file, to which you can apply your own pivot tables and BI analysis. Based on the insights you obtain from this analysis, you might take one or more of the following actions to optimize your new campaigns: Stop running the campaigns on low-performing media sources or lower the bids. (With lower bids, it might make sense to continue running the campaigns on these media sources.) Allocate budget to more productive media sources. Adjust campaign configuration on the low-performing media sources (for example, by targeting better-performing site IDs) to balance the quality of the users they provide with the cost of acquiring them."

      "At a glance: Determine if Predict is the right solution for you, and learn how to get on board. Is Predict right for you? Predict, AppsFlyer\u2019s predictive analytics solution for iOS and SKAdNetwork, streamlines user acquisition campaign management by use of its sophisticated machine learning engine. What's needed to make machine learning work for your apps? Data, data, and more data. So, the first step is to determine if your apps can provide the volume and quality of data that make accurate predictions possible. You should also consider a few additional factors to ensure that you will be able to take full advantage of Predict\u2019s features. Note Our predictive analytics solution for Android is expected soon. We'll be in touch with more news as soon as it's available! Data requirements In order to make accurate predictions, Predict requires: A sufficient length of historical data (an average of 3 months) Sufficient data volume (at least 15 in-app events per day per user). For more information about how Predict uses in-app events to develop its user-level LTV predictions, see Introduction to Predict: How does it work? Sufficient user base (at least 10,000 Daily Active Users and 2,000 daily Non-Organic Installs) If your app generates (or can generate) that level of data, Predict may be right for you. Additional factors Predict provides maximum value to apps with the following characteristics: An app in any vertical in which the majority of a newly-acquired user\u2019s LTV is realized at least 48 hours post-install (for example, apps that incorporate in-app purchases, bookings, or later subscriptions) Apps that allow revenue data to be reported to AppsFlyer \u2013 including ad revenue data Predict uses this data in its predictions for pRevenue (total revenue), pARPU (Predicted Average Revenue Per User), and pROAS (Predicted Return On Ad Spend) Apps integrated with AppsFlyer\u2019s Xpend cost measurement solution. Cost data is used in determining eCPI (effective Cost Per Install) and in predicting pROAS.",
      "How to get on board The Predict AI engine constructs a unique prediction model for each app, based on its historical first-party data. This means that (currently) the onboarding process is time intensive and allows only a handful of customers to get started during any given cycle. The team is currently evaluating requests to participate in the Predict beta. Get in touch with your AppsFlyer CSM or Sales Representative if you\u2019d like to be included. Once your apps are accepted as part of the beta, these are the steps for getting on board: Define additional in-app events Identify and describe ad revenue events Determine retention measurement dates Let the machine learning begin!",
      "Define additional in-app events The higher the number of in-app events defined per app, and the better these events reflect that app\u2019s LTV logic, the more reliable the predicted KPIs will be. There is no limit to the number of events you can measure. In fact, quite the opposite: the more, the better! What types of in-app events should be defined? These are the factors to be considered when defining in-app events: Timing: Of particular importance are events that take place within the first 48 hours of a newly-acquired user\u2019s activity. But don\u2019t stop there! For maximum accuracy and ongoing fine-tuning of each app\u2019s unique prediction logic, Predict needs as many in-app event measurements as possible, throughout the entire user journey. Quality: The quality of an event is determined by how closely it reflects the user journey and LTV calculation for each individual app. So, the first step is to create a list of as many quality in-app events as possible. To streamline the implementation process, use ourin-app event generator. This tool includes all of the typical in-app events per vertical and lets you modify the events according to your business needs. Once complete, share the file with your developer. Important! Get new in-app events set up for reporting to AppsFlyer as quickly as possible, since Predict requires 4 to 6 weeks of history in order to utilize them as part of its predictions. Do new in-app events need to be added to the SDK? You can report in-app events to AppsFlyer either via the AppsFlyer SDK or through server-to-server (S2S) integration. Even if you are currently reporting installs and in-app events to AppsFlyer via the SDK, you can set up additional in-app events to be reported via S2S. This may be a useful option if you wish to avoid updating the SDK and releasing a new version of your app.",
      "Identify and describe ad revenue events In order to effectively predict ad revenue, the Predict AI engine must be able to identify which in-app events are related to ad revenue. We will work with you in completing this process: The Predict team will create a spreadsheet of every in-app event defined for your app. We will ask you to identify which are ad revenue events and define the type of ad revenue they relate to (for example, banner ad, interstitial, ad view, rewarded video, etc.)",
      " Determine retention measurement dates In addition to pRevenue and other revenue-based predictions, Predict is able to predict the percentage of newly-acquired users who will still be using your app {x} number of days post-install. During the onboarding process, you will be able to specify 3 dates (number of days post-install) for which you want us to predict retention. Available retention measurement dates: Days 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 30 Note: Predicted retention measurement is limited to 3 dates as a result of SKAdNetwork's 6-bit conversion value limitation.",
      " Let the machine learning begin! In order to provide accurate LTV predictions for your campaigns, the Predict AI engine must review the app\u2019s historical data using the definitions and factors defined in the previous steps by the app owner and AppsFlyer. The main goal of this training process is to identify correlations between early user-engagement signals and LTV on day 30. It takes approximately 7 days for this intensive initial machine learning process to be completed \u2013 at which point you will begin to see data on the Predict dashboard.",
      "After onboarding Once the onboarding process is complete, you can map predicted KPIs as in-app event postbacks for relevant partners on the Integrated Partners page in the AppsFlyer dashboard. These KPIs are then shared as events with partners, who can use this information to start optimizing your campaigns. You can decide to map all KPIs, some, or none at all based on your advertising strategy and business goals. Mapping is not required to enable Predict's logic or predictions. The events each partner makes available for mapping varies, and some partners support mapping to custom-defined events. Make sure your partners' optimization logic supports the events you are mapping to in the way you intend them to.",
      "Example Let's say you have 2 different apps (App A and App B), and you want to optimize your campaigns differently for each app. The decision of which KPIs to map depends on the types of users you want to focus on: For App A, you want to target your campaigns to users most likely to spend money in the app. So for this app, you could map the SDK event af_predict_revenue to the partner's mobile_purchase event. This allows your partner to optimize your campaigns towards those users most likely to be high-paying users. For App B, you are more interested in users who will continue to use your app over the long term. So for this app, you could map the SDK event af_predict_retention_d30 (% of users predicted to be using your app 30 days post-install) to the partner's session event. This allows your partner to optimize your campaigns to target those users most likely to stay with the app. To map predicted KPIs/events: From the AppsFlyer (Overview) dashboard, go to Configuration > Integrated Partners. Select the relevant integrated partner. On the Integration tab, under In-app event postbacks, map your selected SDK events (those starting with af_predict_) to the selected partner event identifiers.",
      " Notes You should only map SDK retention events for the 3 retention measurement dates you have selected (for example, af_predict_retention_d3,af_predict_retention_d7, af_predict_retention_d21, etc.) The following SDK events are legacy events (no longer supported) and should not be mapped: af_predict_retention_7+ all events starting with af_predict_engagement_ all events starting with af_predict_benefit_ all events starting with af_predict_monetezation_"

      "Note Predict is currently in closed beta. If you are interested in joining the beta and your account generates sufficient data for predictive analysis, contact your CSM or hello@appsflyer.com (participation is limited). Overview Predict, AppsFlyer's advanced predictive analytics solution for iOS and SKAdNetwork, utilizes a deep learning algorithm to construct a unique predictive model for each app in accordance with that app\u2019s historical data. This model provides accurate, pLTV-based predictions of campaign success as soon as 1 day post-install. This article covers the basics of how the predictive logic works and the results it provides. To determine if Predict is the right solution for you and to take the next steps towards getting on board, see Getting started with Predict. Note Our predictive analytics solution for Android is expected soon. We'll be in touch with more news as soon as it's available! The benefits of early prediction Traditional campaign LTV measurement methods typically require approximately 30 days post-install to provide app owners with a fairly accurate indication of whether a newly acquired user is a \u201cgood\u201d user (high LTV) or a \u201cbad\u201d user (low LTV). Even advertisers with the benefit of strong BI resources are able to obtain preliminary indications of user LTV only after 7 to 14 days. This time lag makes the first 7-14 or 30 days of a user acquisition campaign a period of high uncertainty. UA managers are generally encouraged to leave campaigns untouched during this period, in order to obtain \u201cclean'', reliable data for future optimization purposes \u2013 resulting in potential budget losses in cases of poorly performing campaigns or cohorts. Predict was designed to eliminate these periods of high uncertainty by analyzing a user\u2019s early engagement signals and app interaction to predict accurate user-level LTV on day 30 as early as 1 day post-install. By aggregating these user-level LTV predictions and connecting them with cost data, Predict determines predicted campaign- and cohort-level KPIs, allowing you the timely opportunity to: Invest more in the campaigns and cohorts that are yielding good users Stop running campaigns or targeting cohorts that are not yielding good users Adjust campaign and cohort targeting for those performing somewhere in between, or Make bid adjustments for campaigns and cohorts whose costs are disproportionate to the quality of users they yield How does it work? Predict's algorithms are based on the analysis of in-app event data, as recorded by AppsFlyer through SDK or S2S integration. The more closely you can reflect user journey through the measurement of in-app events, the more accurate predictions will be. Of particular significance is a user\u2019s activity within the first 48 hours post-install. For this reason, you are encouraged to set up as many in-app events as possible to measure activity throughout the entire user journey, with specific emphasis on the first 48 hours post-install. For detailed information about in-app event setup, see Getting started with Predict. In order to train its AI engine for each individual app, Predict analyzes the app\u2019s historical data, searching for correlations between early signals of user behavior and user LTV as of day 30. The analysis is far more comprehensive than simply accounting for the occurrence of an event, but it also takes into account all of the factors surrounding the event and their potential contribution to LTV. Many of these correlations are non-intuitive and could be predicted only by this type of advanced data science. Example Let's say a user makes a purchase in your app. In considering the relationship of this purchase to pLTV, Predict considers much more within your app's historical data than just the occurrence of a purchase. It also analyzes numerous additional factors, such as: How much time elapsed between install and purchase? How many app opens were recorded before the purchase? What events did the user perform before the purchase event? Did other in-app events (such as game level achieved, promotion of premium features, discounts offered) have a potential impact on the purchase? Available attribution methods Predict makes its predictions for groups of newly acquired users (or \u201ccohorts\u201d) as measured and reported in your AppsFlyer account. In the post-iOS 14.5+ era, AppsFlyer offers different methods for measuring install attributions: SKAdNetwork (SKAN) attribution AppsFlyer (AF model) attribution Single Source of Truth (SSOT) \u2013 which combines, reconciles, and deduplicates SKAN and AF model attribution To provide a holistic solution for all of your iOS traffic, Predict supports all 3 of these attribution methods. A selector on the Predict dashboard gives you the options to choose which attribution view you want to investigate and easily switch among them. Related reading For a detailed explanation and comparison of the SKAN and AppsFlyer attribution methods, see our Quickstart guide to iOS 14, ATT, and SKAN. For all the details about Single Source of Truth, see our SSOT guide for iOS attribution. Developing campaign and cohort-level KPIs To predict campaign and cohort-level KPIs, Predict uses the following process: Predicts user-level KPIs: Revenue-based predictions --> day 30 Retention-based predictions --> 3 dates you selected during the onboarding process Available retention measurement dates: days 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 30",
      " Aggregates campaign- and cohort-level KPIs based on user-level KPIs Connects actual acquisition cost (eCPI) to predict campaign- and cohort-level ROAS Reports KPIs on the Predict dashboard and in Predict reports",
      "Predicting user-level KPIs Inputs The following are examples of inputs that Predict might consider when predicting user-level KPIs: In-app purchases, subscriptions, ad views, and similar events Number, frequency, and length of sessions Game levels achieved, tutorials completed, recommendations to friends, etc. Note that these are just examples. Actual inputs will vary based on the in-app events you set up to be measured by AppsFlyer. Outputs Predict uses these inputs in order to predict user-level KPIs (outputs) in the following categories: Monetization: Predicted revenue generated by the user as of day 30 (including a prediction of whether a user will generate revenue by day 30 at all) Retention: Prediction of whether the user will still be using the app as of the 3 retention measurement dates you selected during the onboarding process",
      "Note Within the context of Predict, retention has a somewhat different meaning than it does for the AppsFlyer Retention dashboard. For Predict: A retained user on day {x} is not necessarily predicted to open the app on day {x} itself. A retained user on day {x} is predicted to open the app either on day {x} and/or at least one time after day {x} within the 30-day prediction period. Example: Charlie installs the app and is predicted to open it only on day 1. Lucy installs the app and is predicted to open it only on day 7.",
      " User Retained on day 1? Retained on day 7?",
      " Charlie Yes No Lucy Yes Yes",
      "Analysis: Even though Lucy isn't predicted to open the app on day 1, she is still considered a retained user on day 1 because she is predicted to open the app afterwards (on day 7).",

Once Predict receives cost data, we are able to provide further insights such as predicted ROAS. Learn more about cost aggregation using Xpend.",
      "Reporting KPIs User-level predictions are aggregated and combined with the number of users acquired (installs) and user acquisition cost to provide the following campaign- and cohort-level KPIs: Underlying metrics: Users: Total number of new user installs in the campaign or cohort (actual value, as measured by attribution data) pRevenue: Predicted total revenue for the campaign or cohort as of day 30 Note: For the SKAN attribution method only, pRevenue by campaign and cohort is extrapolated as necessary to adjust for users with no SKAdNetwork-reported conversion values. Total cost: Total user acquisition cost for users in the campaign or cohort (actual value, as reported by ad networks) Revenue: pARPU (Predicted Average Revenue Per User): pRevenue \u00f7 Users pROAS (Predicted Return On Ad Spend): pRevenue \u00f7 Total cost p-% Paying users: Predicted number of users with in-app purchases \u00f7 Users p-% Whales: Predicted number of users in the highest revenue bucket \u00f7 Predicted number of paying users Retention: p-% Retention D{x},{y},{z}: Predicted number of users who will be using the app {x},{y}, and {z} days post-install \u00f7 Users {x},{y},{z} above represent the 3 retention measurement dates you selected during the onboarding process",
      "Cost: eCPI (Effective Cost Per Install): Total cost \u00f7 Users All of these metrics are displayed in the Predict dashboard and in Predict reports, broken down by media source, campaign, site ID, and geo.",
      "Predict and SKAdNetwork At its core, Predict is built to leverage initial user engagement data over a limited period of time to provide anonymous user LTV optimization insights, making it particularly valuable for overcoming the primary challenges many marketers face in the context of Apple\u2019s SKAdNetwork (SKAN): Limited 48-hour measurement window Limitation to 1 postback: install + conversion value Privacy-centric measurement and reporting Predict is able to consider an unlimited number of events during SKAN\u2019s limited attribution window, construct accurate, anonymous LTV predictions, then communicate them to SKAN within the context of the required 6-bit limitation. How does Predict work with SKAdNetwork? Predict utilizes all event measurements collected by the AppsFlyer SDK (or S2S) within the first 48 hours to develop anonymous, user-level predictions, such as predicted revenue on day 30. All of these events are recorded without attribution data, ensuring compliance with the ATT framework and maintenance of user privacy. Because of the 6-bit limitation, Predict: Assigns each user to 1 of 5 revenue buckets once their LTV is predicted. The value of the first bucket is 0 and is for users that aren\u2019t predicted to generate revenue. Each of the remaining 4 buckets represents a range of revenue values customized to your business logic and determined during the onboarding process. Assigns each user to 1 of 4 retention buckets. The value of the first bucket is 0 and is for users who aren't predicted to keep using the app. The day ranges for each of the remaining 3 buckets are determined by the 3 retention measurement dates you selected during the onboarding process.",
      " All of these predictions are transmitted to SKAN as a single conversion value, utilizing all 6 permitted bits or fewer. SKAN waits 48 hours, then reports this value to the ad network along with campaign ID and attribution source. Finally, the ad network reports the conversion value (along with attribution data) back to AppsFlyer, where it is decoded, connected to cost, and reported in the Predict dashboard.",
      "A lot to communicate in just 6 bits 6 bits translates to a maximum of 64 values. In order to comply with SKAN's 6-bit conversion value limitation, Predict applies a sophisticated machine-learning algorithm to encode predicted user-level KPIs and transmit them to SKAN as a single conversion value. They're then decoded when sent back to AppsFlyer with the campaign ID. The process is managed entirely by AppsFlyer, without any additional effort on your part. Does Predict comply with iOS 14+ privacy requirements? Yes. Predict does not engage in any activity or utilize any identifiers that require a user\u2019s consent to tracking. What is tracking? Starting with iOS 14.5, advertisers are required to obtain user permission through Apple\u2019s AppTrackingTransparency framework to track them or access their device\u2019s advertising identifier. On its developer website, Apple has provided a definition and specific examples of what it considers to be tracking in this context. Predict\u2019s collection, processing, and reporting of data do not constitute tracking, as further detailed in the following tables:",
      "Tracking definition (from Apple website) Predict",
      " The act of linking user or device data collected from your app with user or device data collected from other companies\u2019 apps, websites, or offline properties for targeted advertising or advertising measurement purposes Predict\u2019s training process utilizes only first-party, non-attribution data to create each app\u2019s unique LTV prediction logic. Predict does not utilize any of the following identifiers: gender, location, age, email address, phone number, IDFA, source app, etc. For purposes of identifying events performed by the same user, Predict utilizes only an internal ID generated by AppsFlyer, which is: Specific to an individual app Not utilized to identify a user among different apps Not transmitted in any form to any third party The user-level pLTV score transmitted by Predict to SKAdNetwork is completely anonymous.",

For example, using an analytics SDK that repurposes the data it collects from your app to enable targeted advertising in other developers\u2019 apps.

Default postbacks Send automatic postbacks to Jampp following user installs and re-engagements. Use this section to define the source of the users that allow sending these postbacks. Select Only events attributed to this partner for events coming only from users attributed to Jampp.Select Events attributed to any partner or organic to have your entire user base available to be reported to Jampp. In-app events settings In this section you can map your AppsFlyer events with Jampp via postbacks. Toggle In-App Event Postbacks to ON Select the Sending Option for all SDK-defined events.- Only events attributed to this partner for events coming only from users attributed to this partner- Events attributed to any partner or organic to have your entire user base available to be reported to the partner Click Add Event to add an SDK Event to the list Complete the following parameters:",
      " Parameter Name Description",
      " SDK Event Name The name of the event, as received by AppsFlyer either from the SDK integrated with your app, or from server to server events.Tip - If you don't see the event you want in the list, make sure to activate the event on a device with a non-organic installation and recheck. Partner Event Identifier The unique name or ID of each event as defined on Jampp's side.Obtain the corresponding Event ID from Jampp and set it in the text field. Send Revenue When unchecked - Send all the parameters of the rich in-app event to the partner, except for the revenue parameter, which is contained in the af_revenue parameter.When checked - Send all the parameters including the revenue value (if it exists in the event).",
      " Attribution link tab In this tab, you can create the attribution links you want to send to Jampp for attributing Jampp's campaigns, ad sets, or even single ads. Note that AppsFlyer DOES NOT save your generated partner's attribution links. This tab is divided into different sections: Attribution link parameters In this section, select which parameters you want to add to the attribution link. Adding parameters to the attribution link here enables you to later perform thorough drill-down analyses. Parameters that are already defined on the attribution link can be edited by adding them and their new values here. Campaign - add it to compare different campaigns running with Jampp.Attribution link parameter: c Adset - set ad set names to compare different ad sets within specific Jampp campaigns.Attribution link parameter: af_adset Ad Name - set ad set names to compare different creatives within specific ad sets within specific campaigns Jampp.Attribution link parameter: af_ad Site ID and Sub Site ID - set Site ID parameter to attribute installs to specific publishers. If many publishers exist, we advise on limiting the number of used site IDs and using the subsite ID parameter, to avoid exceeding the site ID limitations.Attribution link parameters: af_siteid and af_sub_siteid Subscriber Parameters - use any of the 5 subscriber parameters to insert useful values. Note that these parameters get parsed and appear in the raw data report, which makes them very handy for performing data aggregation or filtering.Attribution link parameters: af_sub1, af_sub2, af_sub3, af_sub4, af_sub5 Add any other parameter to the attribution link simply by typing it in a new parameter box. For more information about AppsFlyer Attribution Link Structure and Parameters. Retargeting settings When enabled, AppsFlyer recognizes a link as a retargeting attribution link, rather than a user acquisition link, by adding the &is_retargeting=true to the click recording link. Note that retargeting is currently only supported for click-through and not view-through attribution.Attribution link parameter: is_retargeting. The following setup below is displayed when retargeting is enabled. 1. Standard Link vs. OneLink Select standard attribution link option if: You don't need to deep link with the URL or Plan to use only URI schemes for deep linking select Use OneLink for: Using a single link for both Android and iOS apps or Deep linking using Universal or app links Note that selecting OneLink changes the click recording link from app specific to a OneLink URL. 2. Deep Link URL Use this field if the link is meant to deep link users to any specific activity within your app.Attribution link parameter: af_dpYou can find more information about AppsFlyer's deep linking solution in this guide. 3. Re-engagement Window Set the time period following the re-engagement, where the user's in-app events are attributed to the retargeting media source. You can set the value in days (1-90), hours (up to 23), or even lifetime. Attribution link parameter: af_reengagement_window Click-through attribution This slider allows you to set the maximum time from click to install. Only installs (first launches) that take place within the lookback window may be attributed to Jampp. Attribution link parameter: af_click_lookback More details about the click lookback window here. Click attribution link This is the attribution link that contains all the setup information you have set for it. Send it to Jampp to be activated when leads click on a corresponding ad. View-through attribution lookback window This slider allows you to set the maximum time from impression to install. Only installs (first launches) that take place within this lookback window, following an ad impression, are attributed to Jampp, providing there was no other relevant ad click. You can customize this value to 1-23 hours or 1-7 days. Attribution link parameter: af_viewthrough_lookback More details about the view-through attribution here. Impressions attribution link The impression attribution link contains similar attribution data to the click recording link (besides the different lookback window). Send it to Jampp to be activated when a corresponding ad is watched, usually for 1 second or more.",

      "At a glance: Attribution of Android devices without GAID by using OAID or IMEI. Best practice for viewing attribution data in AppsFlyer. Attribution Android apps in the Chinese domestic market In China, there are several challenges that app owners face: Google Play Services (GPS) is not active in the majority of Android devices, meaning it has no GAID. The use of third-party Android app stores creates opportunities for store hijacking by device manufacturers. Attribution servers are inaccessible or slow to respond. Managing and viewing attribution data from Google Play and third-party Android app stores. Using AppsFlyer, these challenges can be overcome by: Implementing attribution based on OAID Using device IMEI as an alternative to GAID in devices having Android version 28 or earlier Preparing APKs with unique identifiers to detect Android store hijacking Configuring attribution links that are recognized within China Preparing the App Integrate the SDK in the app and prepare the APK using one of the methods according to the target devices Android version. Integrate the SDK in the app Use IMEI and/or OAID instead of GAID In general, Google Play Services is not installed on Android devices supplied in China. This means that there is no GAID to use as a unique attribution identifier. An alternative to using GAID is IMEI and/or OAID, where this is available, to enable attribution recording. OAID: Is a user-resettable advertising ID similar to GAID and IDFA. Requires AppsFlyer Android SDK V5.1.0 and later. From AppsFlyer SDK V5.4.0, SDK will attempt to collect OAID automatically by default. Multiple manufacturers have completed OAID attribution interop testing with AppsFlyer. Including Huawei, Lenovo, OPRO, Vivo, Samsung, and Xiaomi, IMEI: AppsFlyer SDK prevents access to IMEI unless configured otherwise. The general assumption is that Google Play Services is active on the device and that IMEI is not needed. In China, this is not the case. When integrating the AppsFlyer SDK in your app, access to IMEI needs to be enabled. Where necessary, OAID and IMEI should be implemented simultaneously to ensure attribution irrespective of the Android version. This is because access to IMEI is restricted starting with Android 10 (API level 29), released in late 2019. Neither your app nor the AppsFlyer SDK can collect these identifiers. Where no identifier is available AppsFlyer resorts to attribution by Probabilistic modeling. Before you start: AppsFlyer Android SDK V5.1.0 or later is required. Use one of the following procedures: OAID starting from Android API level 29 There are two methods to collect OAID: setCollectOaid setOaidData Instructions to enable the API methods",
      "IMEI Android API level 23-28 There are two methods to collect IMEI: setImeiData setCollectIMEI(true) Use the following code example to integrate the SDK. This code example makes use of the method onConversionDataSuccess. This is the name of the method for getting conversion data starting from SDK V5.0. If you are using an SDK version prior to V5.0, the name of the method is onInstallConversionDataLoaded. We recommend that you upgrade to the SDK current version. Note: Android API level 23 or later requires user permission, using a prompt, to access the IMEI. This may result in the IMEI being retrieved after the activation of the StartTracking API.

      "Preparing the APK Select how attribution data displays in AppsFlyer from: (best practice) Single app: The data of all third-party Android app stores (China domestic) displays under a single but separate app. This means that you see all the domestic Chinese stores attribution data under one app in AppsFlyer. To use this method continue to add the app in AppsFlyer section that follows. Single app consolidated with Google Play store: The attribution of both the third-party app stores and Google Play store display as a single entity. This option requires that the package name of both the Google Play store and the third-party stores is identical. Using this option assume that the app is already defined in AppsFlyer. To use this method continue to preparing the APK/manifest in the section that follows. Multiple apps means that the attribution data of each store is shown under a separate app. For example, each of the following is shown separately, Google Play Store, third-party store A, third-party B, and so on. To use this method, see multiple apps. Adding the app in AppsFlyer To add the app in AppsFlyer: In AppsFlyer, click My Apps. Click Add App.The Add Your App window opens. Select Android out of store APK. Complete the following fields: Android package name: free text Channel name: Must be identical to the channel name in the manifest as explained in the section that follows. Best practice is to set this field to cn_market. App URL",
      "Note: You can create the app using the Pending approval or unpublished option, but this is not recommended. Consult with your CSM before using this method. Preparing the APK/manifest To prepare a separate APK/manifest for each third-party app store as follows: Add the following to the manifest to identify Chinese traffic: < meta-data android:name=\"CHANNEL\" android:value=\"cn_market\"> Note: Parameters are case sensitive. We recommend that you set the channel to cn_market. Choose one of the following methods to identify the store: Manifest method: Add the following line to the AndoridManifest.xml file. The AF_STORE value needs to be unique for each store. <meta-data android:name=\"AF_STORE\" android:value=\"example_store\"/> --OR-- API method: Prepare a separate APK for each third-party app store. Call the setOutOfStore API to set the AF_STORE value. Set a unique value for each store. AppsFlyerLib.getInstance().setOutOfStore(\"example_store\")",
      " The methods described set the parameter AF_STORE which in turn sets the install_app_store field in attribution data. This field is available in: Cohort analysis Raw data reports",
      " Additional attribution considerations Workaround for stores without attribution link support Many third-party Android app stores in China also sell traffic, meaning they are also an ad platform. In some cases, these stores do not support the use of attribution links. The following workaround solutions can be used as an alternative: install_app_store field: (recommended) When installation takes place without an attribution link, AppsFlyer attributes the installation to organic installs. By using the install_app_store field, you can identify the actual source of the install. Note: The install_app_store field is set using the AF_STORE parameter described in the previous section. Preinstall name in the manifest file. Using the preinstall name contained in the manifest. The disadvantage of this method is that where the preinstall APK is leaked to the market, attribution information will be incorrect. When using this method ensure that you have the appropriate commercial terms to protect your APK.",
      " China domestic attribution links When preparing attribution links take into account the following: China-based links For media sources that only have domestic (Chinese) traffic, use the domain links detailed here. These links are recognized from within China and provide a superior user experience. For regular attribution links use: https://app.aflink.com - (aflink.com) For OneLink attribution links use: https://go.onelnk.com (onelnk.com) Note: Before using the onelnk.com domain, contact your AppsFlyer CSM. Note that in weChat only onelnk.com is allowlisted whereas onelink.me is blocked Use af_r Use af_r to make sure users are redirected to either an APK download URL or an APK store, and not to Google Play Store. Note: Frequently, China domestic integrated media sources have this parameter set as &redirect=false in the default attribution URL template. Meaning that redirection will be done by the ad platforms and not by AppsFlyer. For more information about integrated media sources:Android app promotion in China",
      "Detecting store hijacking In third-party app store scenarios, users first install the app from the media source's (ad networks) third-party store. In the case of an installation hijack, a warning pop-up suggests the user installs/updates the app directly from the device (phone) manufacturer's app store. Where the user agrees, the user is re-directed to download from the manufacturer's app store and the APK downloaded. Meaning that the device manufacturer has hijacked the install. The following example illustrates both a legitimate flow and a hijacked flow: Legitimate flow An app user clicks on an ad displayed by media-example, and either immediately downloads the app or is redirected to the legitimate-app-store to download the APP. In AppsFlyer the following attribution information is recorded: Media source: media-example Install app store: legitimate-app-store Hijacked flow An app user clicks on an ad displayed by media-example. When the download is initiated, a warning pop-up appears, suggesting that the user downloads the app from the device manufacturer's app store. If the user agrees, they are redirected to the manufacturer's store and download the app. In AppsFlyer the following attribution information is recorded: Media source: media-example Install-app-store: manufacturer-store Identifying the hijack event in AppsFlyer To identify the hijacked install, you compare the media source and install-app-store fields. A mismatch between the expected install-app-store and the actual install-app-store indicates an installation hijack."
